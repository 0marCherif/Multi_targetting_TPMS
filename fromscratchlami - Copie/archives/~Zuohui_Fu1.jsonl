The convergence of DKGE can be guaranteed theoretically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DKGE achieves superior accuracy than classical hashing functions that map the effective continuous embeddings into discrete codes. Besides, DKGE reaches comparable accuracy with much lower computational complexity and storage compared to many continuous graph embedding methods."}}

Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms -- among others -- are fundamental algorithms driving the underlying mechanism of personalized recommendation. Many of the traditional CF algorithms are designed based on the fundamental idea of mining or learning correlative patterns from data for matching, including memory-based methods such as user/item-based CF as well as learning-based methods such as matrix factorization and deep learning models. However, advancing from correlative learning to causal learning is an important problem, because causal/counterfactual modeling can help us to think outside of the observational data for user modeling and personalization. In this paper, we propose Causal Collaborative Filtering (CCF) -- a general framework for modeling causality in collaborative filtering and recommendation. We first provide a unified causal view of CF and mathematically show that many of the traditional CF algorithms are actually special cases of CCF under simplified causal graphs. We then propose a conditional intervention approach for $do$-calculus so that we can estimate the causal relations based on observational data. Finally, we further propose a general counterfactual constrained learning framework for estimating the user-item preferences. Experiments are conducted on two types of real-world datasets -- traditional and randomized trial data -- and results show that our framework can improve the recommendation performance of many CF algorithms."}}

Currently, most KG embedding models are trained based on negative sampling, i.e., the model aims to maximize some similarity of the connected entities in the KG, while minimizing the similarity of the sampled disconnected entities. Negative sampling helps to reduce the time complexity of model learning by only considering a subset of negative instances, which may fail to deliver stable model performance due to the uncertainty in the sampling procedure. To avoid such deficiency, we propose a new framework for KG embedding -- Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE). The basic idea is to consider all of the negative instances in the KG for model learning, and thus to avoid negative sampling. The framework can be applied to square-loss based knowledge graph embedding models or models whose loss can be converted to a square loss. A natural side-effect of this non-sampling strategy is the increased computational complexity of model learning. To solve the problem, we leverage mathematical derivations to reduce the complexity of non-sampling loss function, which eventually provides us both better efficiency and better accuracy in KG embedding compared with existing models. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our NS-KGE framework can achieve a better performance on efficiency and accuracy over traditional negative sampling based models, and that the framework is applicable to a large class of knowledge graph embedding models."}}

However, BERT possesses a large number of parameters and demands certain resources to deploy. For acceleration, Dynamic Early Exiting for BERT (DeeBERT) has been proposed recently, which incorporates multiple exits and adopts a dynamic early-exit mechanism to ensure efficient inference. While obtaining an efficiency-performance tradeoff, the performances of early exits in multi-exit BERT are significantly worse than late exits. In this paper, we leverage gradient regularized self-distillation for RObust training of Multi-Exit BERT (RomeBERT), which can effectively solve the performance imbalance problem between early and late exits. Moreover, the proposed RomeBERT adopts a one-stage joint training strategy for multi-exits and the BERT backbone while DeeBERT needs two stages that require more training time. Extensive experiments on GLUE datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/romebert/RomeBERT."}}

However, prior research rarely considers the faithfulness of the derived explanations to justify the decision making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that models and evaluates faithfully explainable recommendation under the framework of KG reasoning. Specifically, we propose neural logic reasoning for explainable recommendation (LOGER) by drawing on interpretable logical rules to guide the path reasoning process for explanation generation. We experiment on three large-scale datasets in the e-commerce domain, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in delivering high-quality recommendations as well as ascertaining the faithfulness of the derived explanation."}}

Therefore, it is important to identify and solve the unfairness issues in recommendation scenarios. In this paper, we address the unfairness problem in recommender systems from the user perspective. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged groups according to their level of activity, and conduct experiments to show that current recommender systems will behave unfairly between two groups of users. Specifically, the advantaged users (active) who only account for a small proportion in data enjoy much higher recommendation quality than those disadvantaged users (inactive). Such bias can also affect the overall performance since the disadvantaged users are the majority. To solve this problem, we provide a re-ranking approach to mitigate this unfairness problem by adding constraints over evaluation metrics. The experiments we conducted on several real-world datasets with various recommendation algorithms show that our approach can not only improve group fairness of users in recommender systems, but also achieve better overall recommendation performance."}}

We propose a context-aware interaction network (COIN) to properly align two sequences and infer their semantic relationship. Specifically, each interaction block includes (1) a context-aware cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate contextual information when aligning two sequences, and (2) a gate fusion layer to flexibly interpolate aligned representations. We apply multiple stacked interaction blocks to produce alignments at different levels and gradually refine the attention results. Experiments on two question matching datasets and detailed analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."}}

Without identifying the connection between appearing people and character names, a model is not able to obtain a genuine understanding of the plots. Video Story Question Answering (VSQA) offers an effective way to benchmark higher-level comprehension abilities of a model. However, current VSQA methods merely extract generic visual features from a scene. With such an approach, they remain prone to learning just superficial correlations. In order to attain a genuine understanding of who did what to whom, we propose a novel model that continuously refines character-aware relations. This model specifically considers the characters in a video story, as well as the relations connecting different characters and objects. Based on these signals, our framework enables weakly-supervised face naming through multi-instance co-occurrence matching and supports high-level reasoning utilizing Transformer structures. We train and test our model on the six diverse TV shows in the TVQA dataset, which is by far the largest and only publicly available dataset for VSQA. We validate our proposed approach over TVQA dataset through extensive ablation study."}}
