Adversarial Robustness for Free!", "abstract": "In this paper we show how to achieve state-of-the-art certified adversarial robustness to 2-norm bounded perturbations by relying exclusively on off-the-shelf pretrained models. To do so, we instantiate the denoised smoothing approach of Salman et al. by combining a pretrained denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a standard high-accuracy classifier. This allows us to certify 71% accuracy on ImageNet under adversarial perturbations constrained to be within a 2-norm of 0.5, an improvement of 14 percentage points over the prior certified SoTA using any approach, or an improvement of 30 percentage points over denoised smoothing. We obtain these results using only pretrained diffusion models and image classifiers, without requiring any fine tuning or retraining of model parameters."}}

Motivated by the findings that human visual sys-tem pays more attention to global structure (e.g., shapes) for recognition while CNNs are biased towards local texture features in images, in this work we aim to analyze whether \"edge features\" could improve the recognition robustness in these scenarios, and if so, to what extent? To answer these questions and systematically evaluate the global structure features, we focus on shape features and pro-pose two edge-enabled pipelines EdgeNetRob and Edge-GANRob, forcing the CNNs to rely more on edge features. Specifically, EdgeNetRob and EdgeGANRob first explicitly extract shape structure features from a given image via an edge detection algorithm. Then EdgeNetRob trains down-stream learning tasks directly on the extracted edge features, while EdgeGANRob reconstructs a new image by refilling the texture information with a trained generative adversarial network (GANs). To reduce the sensitivity of edge detection algorithms to perturbations, we additionally propose a robust edge detection approach Robust Canny based on vanilla Canny. Based on our evaluation, we find that EdgeNetRob can help boost model robustness under different attack scenarios at the cost of the clean model accuracy. EdgeGANRob, on the other hand, is able to improve the clean model accuracy compared to EdgeNetRob while preserving the robustness. This shows that given such edge features, how to leverage them matters for robustness, and it also depends on data properties. Our systematic studies on edge structure features under different settings will shed light on future robust feature exploration and optimization."}}

We borrow the scale-space extreme value idea from SIFT, and propose extreme value preserving networks (EVPNets). Experiments demonstrate that EVPNets can achieve similar or better accuracy than conventional CNNs, while achieving much better robustness on a set of adversarial attacks (FGSM,PGD,etc) even without adversarial training."}}
