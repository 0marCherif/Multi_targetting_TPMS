However, various factors, such as the prohibitive purchasing costs and the scarcity of large-scale charging facilities, hinder the wider adoption of e-buses. Thus, to effectively cut the cost of building and maintaining urban e-bus systems, we optimize the dispatching strategy for urban e-bus systems to satisfy public transportation demands with the minimum e-bus fleet. Specifically, we propose to systematically exploit at city-scale cross-line dispatching, a smart dispatching strategy allowing one bus to serve multiple bus lines when necessary. Technically, we construct a novel and generalizable graph-theoretic model for urban e-bus systems integrating e-buses non-negligible charging time, the spatio-temporal constraints of bus trips, and various other real-world factors. We prove that it is NP-hard, and has no <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(2-\\epsilon)$</tex-math></inline-formula> -approximation algorithm. Next, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem with a guaranteed approximation ratio. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world bus dataset from Shenzhen, China, which validate the effectiveness of our algorithms. As shown by our experimental results, to serve 300 bus lines, our dispatching strategy needs 38.2% less e-buses than the one currently used in practice."}}

Existing works have devised manifold techniques to discover truth from collected noisy data, but they frequently ignore various expertise of workers and dynamic information of crowdsensing system, thus leading to error-prone estimated truth and unqualified sensing data. In this paper, we design an online location-aware crowdsensing system to accurately estimate truth and efficiently assign tasks. Specifically, we unify diverse types of numerical and categorical tasks based on probabilistic graphical model, and then propose unsupervised learning methods which can dynamically infer ground truth and various worker expertise at the same time. Furthermore, we develop online task allocation schemes to gradually gather high quality data considering location awareness and inferred worker expertise. In particular, we convert the complicated task allocation into the additive form of probability improvement and entropy reduction, thereby solving the allocation problem via linearly selecting worker-task pair with low computation complexity. We finally carry out extensive evaluations using two datasets collected by our smartphones, where results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the state-of-the-art approaches."}}

Existing robust RL methods mostly aim to achieve the max-min robustness by optimizing the policy's performance in the worst-case environment. However, in practice, a user that uses an RL policy may have different preferences over its performance across environments. Clearly, the aforementioned max-min robustness is oftentimes too conservative to satisfy user preference. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate user preference into policy learning in robust RL, and propose a novel User-Oriented Robust RL (UOR-RL) framework. Specifically, we define a new User-Oriented Robustness (UOR) metric for RL, which allocates different weights to the environments according to user preference and generalizes the max-min robustness metric. To optimize the UOR metric, we develop two different UOR-RL training algorithms for the scenarios with or without a priori known environment distribution, respectively. Theoretically, we prove that our UOR-RL training algorithms converge to near-optimal policies even with inaccurate or completely no knowledge about the environment distribution. Furthermore, we carry out extensive experimental evaluations in 4 MuJoCo tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that UOR-RL is comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines under the average and worst-case performance metrics, and more importantly establishes new state-of-the-art performance under the UOR metric."}}

However, the increasing number of EVs inevitably create massive charging demands that are challenging to satisfy. Oftentimes in practice, EVs have to wait in queues for a long time outside charging stations before chargers become available. To address this challenge, we fully capture the elasticity of EVs\u2019 charging demands in response to the charging prices, and propose a dynamic charging pricing mechanism that jointly controls the lengths of the demand queues at multiple charging stations and maximizes the charging platform\u2019s long-term profit for offering charging services. Clearly, such an approach is more feasible than the financially and temporally expensive way of constructing extra charging facilities. Technically, we augment the Lyapunov stochastic optimization technique to decompose the challenging long-term decision-making problem into a series of single-time-slot optimization programs which require zero knowledge of future system parameters. However, due to the correlation of charging demands among different stations, the aforementioned optimization program in each time slot is non-convex. We handle the non-convexity by jointly constructing independent sets of charging stations and adapting the block coordinate descent method to iteratively obtain approximately optimal charging prices. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations based on the real-world dataset in the Chinese city Shenzhen which consists of 4000 taxis and 171 charging stations, we demonstrate that our control policy ensures an arbitrarily close-to-optimal profit with a flexible trade-off between the profit and queue lengths, has a low computational complexity, and requires zero knowledge of future system dynamics."}}

Efficiency (e.g., gross merchandise volume) has always been an important metric for such platforms. However, only focusing on the efficiency inevitably ignores the fairness of driver incomes, which could impair the sustainability of the overall ride-hailing system in the long run. To optimize the aforementioned two essential metrics, order dispatching and driver repositioning play an important role, as they impact not only the immediate, but also the future order-serving outcomes of drivers. Thus, in this paper, we aim to exploit joint order dispatching and driver repositioning to optimize both the long-term efficiency and fairness for ride-hailing platforms. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, referred to as JDRL, to help drivers make distributed order selection and repositioning decisions. Specifically, to cope with the variable action space, JDRL segments the action space into a fixed number of action groups, and fixes the policy output dimension for order selection as the number of action groups. In terms of the fairness criterion, JDRL adopts the max-min fairness, and augments the vanilla policy gradient to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between a minimization step and a policy improvement step to maximize both the worst and the overall performance of agents. In addition, we provide the theoretical convergence guarantee of our JDRL training algorithm even under non-convex policy networks and stochastic gradient updating. Extensive experiments are conducted with three public real-world ride-hailing order datasets, including over 2 million orders in Haikou, China, over 5 million orders in Chengdu, China, and over 6 million orders in New York City, USA. Experimental results show that JDRL demonstrates a consistent advantage compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both efficiency and fairness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits joint order dispatching and driver repositioning to optimize both the long-term efficiency and fairness in a ride-hailing system."}}

At the same time, electric taxis (e-taxis) are increasingly adopted and gradually replacing gasoline taxis in today\u2019s public transportation systems due to their environmental-friendly nature. Though effective for traditional gasoline taxis, existing relocation recommendation schemes are rather suboptimal for e-taxi drivers\u2019 user experience. On one hand, the existing schemes take no account of taxis\u2019 refueling decisions, as the refueling durations of gasoline taxis are usually short enough to be ignored. However, the charging duration of the e-taxis spent at charging stations can be as long as hours. Obviously, an e-taxi\u2019s battery could be easily depleted by the continuous relocations suggested by existing schemes, and thus will have to be charged for a long time afterwards, making the e-taxi driver miss numerous order-serving opportunities. On the other hand, charging posts are typically sparsely and unevenly distributed across a city. With no consideration of charging opportunities, existing schemes could probably send an e-taxi to an area with no charging post around, even though its battery is running low. To optimize e-taxi drivers\u2019 user experience, in this paper, we design a joint <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">charging and relocation recommendation system for e-taxi drivers (CARE)</i> . We take the perspective of e-taxi drivers and formulate their decision making as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem where each e-taxi driver aims to maximize his own cumulative rewards. More specifically, we propose a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-agent mean field hierarchical reinforcement learning (MFHRL)</i> framework. The hierarchical architecture of MFHRL helps the proposed CARE provide far-sighted charging and relocation recommendations for e-taxi drivers. Besides, we integrate each hierarchical level of MFHRL separately with the mean field approximation to incorporate e-taxis\u2019 mutual influences in decision making. We set up a simulator with one of the largest real-world e-taxi datasets in Shenzhen, China, which contains the GPS trajectory data and transaction data of 3848 e-taxis from June 1st to June 30th, 2017, coupled with 165 charging stations including 317 fast charging posts and 1421 slow charging posts. We adopt this simulator to generate 6 dynamic urban environments, which reflect the different real-world scenarios faced by e-taxi drivers. In all of these environments, we conduct extensive experiments to validate that the proposed MFHRL framework greatly outperforms all baselines by significantly increasing the rewards obtained by e-taxi drivers. Besides, we also show that the charging policy learned by MFHRL can effectively reduce the range anxiety of e-taxi drivers, which significantly boosts e-taxi drivers\u2019 quality of experience."}}

Due to the complexity and uncertainty of urban road conditions, how to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal correlation and make accurate predictions is very challenging. In most of existing works, urban road network is often modeled as a fixed graph based on local proximity. However, such modeling is not sufficient to describe the dynamics of the road network and capture the global contextual information. In this paper, we consider constructing the road network as a dynamic weighted graph through attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose to seek both spatial neighbors and semantic neighbors to make more connections between road nodes. We propose a novel Spatiotemporal Adaptive Gated Graph Convolution Network (STAG-GCN) to predict traffic conditions for several time steps ahead. STAG-GCN mainly consists of two major components: (1) multivariate self-attention Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) is utilized to capture local and long-range temporal dependencies across recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic observations; (2) mix-hop AG-GCN extracts selective spatial and semantic dependencies within multi-layer stacking through adaptive graph gating mechanism and mix-hop propagation mechanism. The output of different components are weighted fused to generate the final prediction results. Extensive experiments on two real-world large scale urban traffic dataset have verified the effectiveness, and the multi-step forecasting performance of our proposed models outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Contrary to common practice, we acknowledge that mobile services are heterogeneous and the limited storage resources of ECs allow only a subset of services to be placed at the same time. This paper presents a jointly optimized design of cooperative placement and scheduling framework, named JCPS, that pursues <i>social cost minimization</i> over time while ensuring diverse user demands. Our main contribution is a novel perspective on cost reduction by exploiting the <i>spatial-temporal diversities</i> in <i>workload and resource cost</i> among federated ECs. To build a practical edge cloud federation system, we have to consider two major challenges: <i>user deadline preference</i> and <i>ECs\u2019 strategic behaviors</i> . We first formulate and solve the problem of spatially strategic optimization without deadline awareness, which is proved <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {NP}$</tex-math></inline-formula> -hard. By leveraging user deadline tolerance, we develop a Lyapunov-based <i>deadline-driven</i> joint cooperative mechanism under the scenario where the workload and resource information of ECs are known for one-shot global cost minimization. The <i>service priority</i> imposed by deadline urgency drives time-critical placement and scheduling, which, combined with cooperative control, enables workloads migrated across different times and ECs. Given selfishness of individual ECs, we further design an auction-based cooperative mechanism to elicit <i>truthful bids</i> on workload and resource cost. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations are performed, validating the efficiency of JCPS in realizing cost reduction and user satisfaction."}}
