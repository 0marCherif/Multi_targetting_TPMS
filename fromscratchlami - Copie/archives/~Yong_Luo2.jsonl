Despite the significance,  ground states preparation (GSP) is classically intractable for large-scale Hamiltonians. Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern quantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As such, the performance enhancement of QNNs becomes the core in GSP. Empirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ans\\\"atze generally experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ans\\\"atze, while theoretical explanations remain vague. To fill this knowledge gap, here we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of QNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric ans\\\"atze attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension, which requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the over-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast convergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme to automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and asymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit symmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results of EQNTK and the effectiveness of SP. "}}

The antenna element consists of a pair of opened-loop dipoles for dual-polarization and its three inherent resonant modes are shifted closer to form a wide bandwidth. With additional U-shaped slots etched around the feed point, the input impedance of the antenna element is matched to 50 Ohm. The fabricated antenna element operates from 1.8 to 4.0 GHz, having 75.9% (VSWR \u2264 2) impedance bandwidth and high port-to-port isolation (>25 dB). It also achieves a 67\u00b11\u00b0 beamwidth in H-plane and 68.7 \u00b1 3.3\u00b0 in V-plane with 8.5 \u00b1 1 dBi gain across the supported bands. By using six antenna elements and designing RF phase shifting module (RFPSM) based on vector modulators, a six-element dual-polarized array with electrically downtilt is also fabricated and measured, realizing a peak gain of 16.8 dBi, a similar beamwidth in H-plane as single antenna element and an electrically downtilt in V-plane from 0\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 which is preferred in communication applications. This antenna array could be used for future 5G communication and other applications."}}

Existing device-fingerprinting solutions either ignore the influence of the type of network traffic or separately learn a fingerprinting model for each traffic type. This often leads to suboptimal solutions, especially when training data are limited. Considering that the data distributions of different traffic types may be different but related, we propose a novel multitask learning method to learn the fingerprinting models for several traffic types simultaneously. Specifically, we first design a system for device fingerprinting using the popular k-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach. Then, a novel distance metric learning (DML) algorithm termed online multitask metric learning (OMTML) is developed to improve the distance estimation in our system. OMTML enables the models describing different traffic types to help each other during the metric learning procedure, and thus improving their respective accuracies. OMTML can also be updated adaptively, and the updating process is efficient. The experimental results show that the proposed KNN-based system outperforms the artificial neural network (ANN)-based counterpart significantly. Besides, the comparisons of our OMTML and other representative online and multitask DML approaches demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed metric learning method."}}

This antenna element can operate at two dual-wideband of 3250-3820 MHz and 4790-6200 MHz with three resonance frequencies which can fully cover 5G NR (New Radio) BandN78 (3300-3800 MHz), China 5G-Band of 4800-5000 MHz and LTE Band-46 (5150-5925 MHz). The main parameters that characterize the performance of the proposed MIMO antenna system, such as bandwidth, reflection coefficient, isolation (more than 10.5 dB), total radiation efficiency (more than 43%), ECC (envelope correlation coefficient, less than 0.12) and CC (channel capacity, 34.9-37.6 bps/Hz), are analyzed and presented in this paper. Besides, the effects of single-hand and dual-hand on performance of the MIMO antenna system are also discussed.

In order to improve the performance of these offloaded users, an interference mitigation scheme based on resource partitioning is employed in the literature. Specifically, a fraction of resource blocks (RBs) is reserved for the offloaded users, and then the SIRs of these users will be enhanced because there is only interference from the SBS tier. In summary, the combination of offloading and resource partitioning is called joint offloading and resource partitioning scheme, which has been investigated in the HUDNs built on the 2D space, while it has rarely been deliberated in 3D HUDNs that are used to model the scenario of high-rise buildings. Moreover, a two-tier 3D HUDN is proposed in this paper, and the MBS and SBS tiers are modeled as two independent Poisson point processes. Then, the SIR and rate meta distributions, which are used to characterize the fraction of users that achieve a desired link reliability given SIR or rate thresholds, are formulated for the proposed 3D HUDN. Lastly, numerical results show that with the usage of the joint offloading and resource partitioning scheme, the performance of the proposed 3D HUND can be significantly improved."}}

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been widely used to simulate the near-surface wind speed. By combining the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model with the Three-dimensional variation (3DVar) data assimilation system, our work applied satellite data assimilation to the wind resource assessment tasks of coastal wind farms in Guangdong, China. We compared the simulation results with wind speed observation data from seven wind observation towers in the Guangdong coastal area, and the results showed that satellite data assimilation with the WRF model can significantly reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and improve the index of agreement (IA) and correlation coefficient (R). In different months and at different height layers (10, 50, and 70 m), the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) can be reduced by a range of 0&ndash;0.8 m/s from 2.5&ndash;4 m/s of the original results, the IA can be increased by a range of 0&ndash;0.2 from 0.5&ndash;0.8 of the original results, and the R can be increased by a range of 0&ndash;0.3 from 0.2&ndash;0.7 of the original results. The results of the wind speed Weibull distribution show that, after data assimilation was used, the WRF model was able to simulate the distribution of wind speed more accurately. Based on the numerical simulation, our work proposes a combined wind resource evaluation approach of numerical modeling and data assimilation, which will benefit the wind power assessment of wind farms."}}

Although there have been dozens of hashing approaches, few of them take the hierarchical structure of the image categories into consideration. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the category taxonomy information in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model for image hashing. In particular, we learn an agent to predict the hashing codes sequentially under the DRL theme. Each coordinate of the hashing function can take the errors incurred by previous ones into consideration and hence more reliable hashing codes can be obtained than learning them independently. Besides, we design a novel level-specific reward function to gradually refine the hashing function according to the taxonomy information. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Subsequently, bond graph theory is used to create heat source system models. Working conditions and heat system boundary conditions for theoretical analysis are established using test data from an actual vehicle. This is followed by using FLUENT software to perform multi-core and parallel heat calculations of coupled heat flow fields under normal and high intensity working conditions. Finally, MATLAB and Control Desk universal modular experiment and instrumentation software are used to verify the results of the simulation on an actual vehicle. The results indicate good agreement between the results of the numerical model simulation and the measurements from the test vehicle. The relative error is less than 5%.
