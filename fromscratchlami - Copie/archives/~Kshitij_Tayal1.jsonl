This problem is challenging due to the non-stationary processes that underlie the dynamics of data observations over space and time. Hence, directly transferring models from well-observed data entities to unmonitored target entity often lead to sub-optimal performance due to the shift in data distribution. This paper proposes a new meta-transfer learning framework that automatically estimates the similarity amongst entities to transfer knowledge from well-observed entities to unmonitored entities. A sequence autoencoder embeds temporal behaviors of time series data and simulations generated by traditional physics-based models. This embedding model is trained in a meta-transfer learning framework under the guidance of source-to-source transferring experiences. We tested this method in streamflow prediction for multiple river segments in the Delaware River Basin, an ecologically diverse region along the eastern coast of the United States. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in predicting streamflow for unmonitored stream segments compared to a diverse set of baselines. Our method also creates meaningful similarity estimates amongst segments to guide the transfer learning process."}}

Building accurate broad-scale models for lake temperature prediction remains challenging in practice due to the variability in the data distribution across different lake systems monitored by static and time-series data. In this paper, to tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel machine learning based approach for integrating static and time-series data in deep recurrent models, which we call Invertibility-Aware-Long Short-Term Memory(IA-LSTM), and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting lake temperature. Our proposed method integrates components of the Invertible Network and LSTM to better predict temperature profiles (forward modeling) and infer the static features (i.e., inverse modeling) that can eventually enhance the prediction when static variables are missing. We evaluate our method on predicting the temperature profile of 450 lakes in the Midwestern U.S. and report relative improvement of 4% to capture data heterogeneity and simultaneously outperform baseline predictions by 12% when static features are unavailable."}}

However, building accurate broad-scale models for streamflow remains challenging in practice due to the variability in the dominant hydrologic processes, which are best captured by sets of process-related basin characteristics. Existing basin characteristics suffer from noise and uncertainty, among many other things, which adversely impact model performance. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-guided Self-Supervised Learning (KGSSL) inverse framework to extract system characteristics from driver(input) and response(output) data. This first-of-its-kind framework achieves robust performance even when characteristics are corrupted or missing. We evaluate the KGSSL framework in the context of stream flow modeling using CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) which is a widely used hydrology benchmark dataset. Specifically, KGSSL outperforms baseline by 16% in predicting missing characteristics. Furthermore, in the context of forward modelling, KGSSL inferred characteristics provide a 35% improvement in performance over a standard baseline when the static characteristic are unknown."}}

Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort. We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work."}}
