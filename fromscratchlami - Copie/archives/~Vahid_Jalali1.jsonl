Acquiring the required case adaptation knowledge is a classic problem. A popular method for addressing it is the case difference heuristic (CDH) approach, which learns adaptations from pairs of cases based on their problem differences and solution differences. The CDH approach was originally used to generate adaptation rules, but recent CBR research on case-based regression has investigated replacing learning rules with learning CDH-based network models for adaptation. This paper presents and evaluates a neural network-based CDH approach for learning adaptation models for classification, C-NN-CDH. It examines three variants, (1) training a single neural network on problem-solution differences, (2) segmenting adaptation knowledge by the classes of source cases, with a separate neural network to generate adaptations for each class, and (3) adapting from an ensemble of source cases and taking the majority vote. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance compared to previous research on statistical methods for computing CDH differences for classification. Additional results support that C-NN-CDH achieves classification performance comparable to that of multiple classic classification approaches."}}

To provide CBR systems with adaptation knowledge, machine learning methods have been developed for automatically generating adaptation rules. An influential approach uses the case difference heuristic (CDH) to generate rules by comparing pairs of cases in the case base. The CDH method has been studied for case-based prediction of numeric values (regression) from inputs with primarily numeric features, and has proven effective in that context. However, previous work has not attempted to apply the CDH method to classification tasks, to generate rules for adapting categorical solutions. This article introduces an approach to applying the CDH to cases with categorical features and target values, based on the generalized case value difference heuristic (GCVDH). It also proposes a classification method using ensembles of GCVDH-generated rules, ensemble of adaptations for classification (EAC), an extension to our previous work on ensembles of adaptations for regression (EAR). It reports on an evaluation comparing the accuracy of EAC to three baseline methods on six standard domains, as well as comparing EAC to an ablation relying on single adaptation rules, and assesses the effect of training/test size on accuracy. Results are encouraging for the effectiveness of the GCVDH approach and for the value of applying ensembles of learned adaptation rules for classification."}}

However, acquiring the knowledge required for case adaptation is a classic challenge for CBR. This motivates the use of machine learning methods to generate adaptation knowledge. A popular approach uses the case difference heuristic (CDH) to generate adaptation rules from pairs of cases in the case base, based on the premise that the observed differences in case solutions result from the differences in the problems they solve, so can form the basic of rules to adapt cases with similar problem differences. Extensive research has successfully applied the CDH approach to adaptation rule learning for case-based regression (numerical prediction) tasks. However, classification tasks have been outside of its scope. The work presented in this paper addresses that gap by extending CDH-based learning of adaptation rules to apply to cases with categorical features and solutions. It presents the generalized case value heuristic to assess case and solution differences and applies it in an ensemble-based case-based classification method, ensembles of adaptations for classification (EAC), built on the authors' previous work on ensembles of adaptations for regression (EAR). Experimental results support the effectiveness of EAC."}}

Controlling the growth of the case base is a fundamental problem, and research on case-base maintenance has developed methods for compacting case bases while maintaining system competence, primarily by competence-based deletion strategies assuming static case adaptation knowledge. This paper proposes adaptation-guided case-base maintenance (AGCBM), a case-base maintenance approach exploiting the ability to dynamically generate new adaptation knowledge from cases. In AGCBM, case retention decisions are based both on cases' value as base cases for solving problems and on their value for generating new adaptation rules. The paper illustrates the method for numerical prediction tasks (case-based regression) in which adaptation rules are generated automatically using the case difference heuristic. In comparisons of AGCBM to five alternative methods in four domains, for varying case base densities, AGCBM outperformed the alternatives in all domains, with greatest benefit at high compression."}}
