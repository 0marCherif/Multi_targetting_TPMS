In many scenarios however, a large proportion of the clients are probably in possession of low-quality data that are biased, noisy or even irrelevant. As a result, they could significantly slow down the convergence of the global model we aim to build and also compromise its quality. In light of this, we propose FedProf, a novel algorithm for optimizing FL under such circumstances without breaching data privacy. The key of our approach is a data representation profiling and matching scheme that uses the global model to dynamically profile data representations and allows for low-cost, lightweight representation matching. Based on the scheme we adaptively score each client and adjust its participation probability so as to mitigate the impact of low-value clients on the training process. We have conducted extensive experiments on public datasets using various FL settings. The results show that FedProf effectively reduces the number of communication rounds and overall time (up to 4.5x speedup) for the global model to converge and provides accuracy gain."}}
