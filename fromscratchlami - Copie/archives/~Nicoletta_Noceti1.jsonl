This level of communicative skills and interpretation, available to humans, is essential for collaborative robots if they are to interact naturally and effectively. For example, suppose a robot is handing over a fragile object. In that case, the human who receives it should be informed of its fragility in advance, through an immediate and implicit message, i.e., by the direct modulation of the robot\u2019s action. This work investigates the perception of object manipulations performed with a communicative intent by two robots with different embodiments (an iCub humanoid robot and a Baxter robot). We designed the robots\u2019 movements to communicate carefulness or not during the transportation of objects. We found that not only this feature is correctly perceived by human observers, but it can elicit as well a form of motor adaptation in subsequent human object manipulations. In addition, we get an insight into which motion features may induce to manipulate an object more or less carefully."}}

This cognitive ability implies the remapping of seen actions in our perspective. However, in the field of robotics the perspective mismatch between demonstrator and imitator is usually neglected under the assumption that the imitator has access to the explicit joints configuration of the demonstrator or that they both share the same perspective of the environment. Focusing on the perspective translation problem, in this paper we propose a generative approach that shifts the perspective of actions from third person to first person by using RGB videos. In addition to the first person view of the action our model generates an embedded representation of it. This numerical description is autonomously learnt following a time-consistent pattern and without the need of human supervision. In the experimental evaluation, we show that it is possible to exploit these two information to infer robot control during the imitation phase. Additionally, after training on synthetic data, we tested our model in a real scenario."}}
