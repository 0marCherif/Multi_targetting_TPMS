These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been extensively studied in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a novel selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of transitions of the horizon across a retinal region. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour-opponency in transient Suppressed-by-Contrast RGCs (tSbC), a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts, which we found to be characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head-or eye-movements across the horizon. Because tSbCs reliably detected these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance."}}

However, less attention has been paid to the quality of dataset labeling as compared to research into networks and models, despite data quality consistently having a high impact on final accuracies. In this work, we trained a U-Net model for tree cover segmentation in 30 cm WorldView-3 imagery and assessed the impact of training data quality on segmentation accuracy. We produced two reference tree cover masks of different qualities by labeling images accurately or roughly and trained the model on a combination of both, with varying proportions. Our results show that models trained with accurately delineated masks achieved higher accuracy (88.06%) than models trained on masks that were only roughly delineated (81.13%). When combining the accurately and roughly delineated masks at varying proportions, we found that the segmentation accuracy increased with the proportion of accurately delineated masks. Furthermore, we applied semisupervised active learning techniques to identify an efficient strategy for selecting images for labeling. This showed that semisupervised active learning saved nearly 50% of the labeling cost when applied to accurate masks, while maintaining high accuracy (88.07%). Our study suggests that accurate mask delineation and semisupervised active learning are essential for efficiently generating training datasets in the context of tree cover segmentation from high-resolution satellite imagery."}}

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can serve a variety of goals for improving our understanding of this complex system, not only serving as predictive digital twins of sensory cortex for novel hypothesis generation in silico, but also incorporating bio-inspired architectural motifs to progressively bridge the gap between biological and machine vision. The mouse has recently emerged as a popular model system to study visual information processing, but no standardized large-scale benchmark to identify state-of-the-art models of the mouse visual system has been established. To fill this gap, we propose the Sensorium benchmark competition. We collected a large-scale dataset from mouse primary visual cortex containing the responses of more than 28,000 neurons across seven mice stimulated with thousands of natural images, together with simultaneous behavioral measurements that include running speed, pupil dilation, and eye movements. The benchmark challenge will rank models based on predictive performance for neuronal responses on a held-out test set, and includes two tracks for model input limited to either stimulus only (Sensorium) or stimulus plus behavior (Sensorium+). We provide a starting kit to lower the barrier for entry, including tutorials, pre-trained baseline models, and APIs with one line commands for data loading and submission. We would like to see this as a starting point for regular challenges and data releases, and as a standard tool for measuring progress in large-scale neural system identification models of the mouse visual system and beyond."}}

A central problem of all existing attempts at one-shot object detection is the generalization gap: Object categories used during training are detected much more reliably than novel ones. We here show that this generalization gap can be nearly closed by increasing the number of object categories used during training. Doing so allows us to improve generalization from seen to unseen classes from 45% to 89% and improve the state-of-the-art on COCO by 5.4 AP50 (from 22.0 to 27.5). \nWe verify that the effect is caused by the number of categories and not the number of training samples, and that it holds for different models, backbones and datasets. This result suggests that the key to strong few-shot detection models may not lie in sophisticated metric learning approaches, but instead simply in scaling the number of categories. We hope that our findings will help to better understand the challenges of few-shot learning and encourage future data annotation efforts to focus on wider datasets with a broader set of categories rather than gathering more samples per category."}}

It is currently unknown how many excitatory cortical cell types exist and what their defining morphological features are. Here we present GraphDINO, a purely data-driven approach to learn low-dimensional representations of 3D neuronal morphologies from unlabeled large-scale datasets. GraphDINO is a novel transformer-based representation learning method for spatially-embedded graphs. To enable self-supervised learning on transformers, we (1) developed data augmentation strategies for spatially-embedded graphs, (2) adapted the positional encoding and (3) introduced a novel attention mechanism, AC-Attention, which combines attention-based global interaction between nodes and classic graph convolutional processing. We show, in two different species and across multiple brain areas, that this method yields morphological cell type clusterings that are on par with manual feature-based classification by experts, but without using prior knowledge about the structural features of neurons. Moreover, it outperforms previous approaches on quantitative benchmarks predicting expert labels. Our method could potentially enable data-driven discovery of novel morphological features and cell types in large-scale datasets. It is applicable beyond neuroscience in settings where samples in a dataset are graphs and graph-level embeddings are desired."}}

Most such DNNs consist of a convolutional network (core) shared across all neurons which learns a representation of neural computation in visual cortex and a neuron-specific readout that linearly combines the relevant features in this representation. The goal of this paper is to test whether such a representation is indeed generally characteristic for visual cortex, i.e. generalizes between animals of a species, and what factors contribute to obtaining such a generalizing core. To push all non-linear computations into the core where the generalizing cortical features should be learned, we devise a novel readout that reduces the number of parameters per neuron in the readout by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous state-of-the-art. It does so by taking advantage of retinotopy and learns a Gaussian distribution over the neuron\u2019s receptive field position. With this new readout we train our network on neural responses from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and obtain a gain in performance of 7% compared to the previous state-of-the-art network. We then investigate whether the convolutional core indeed captures general cortical features by using the core in transfer learning to a different animal. When transferring a core trained on thousands of neurons from various animals and scans we exceed the performance of training directly on that animal by 12%, and outperform a commonly used VGG16 core pre-trained on imagenet by 33%. In addition, transfer learning with our data-driven core is more data-efficient than direct training, achieving the same performance with only 40% of the data. Our model with its novel readout thus sets a new state-of-the-art for neural response prediction in mouse visual cortex from natural images, generalizes between animals, and captures better characteristic cortical features than current task-driven pre-training approaches such as VGG16."}}

Contrary to high-predictive deep learning models, our DN-based model\u2019s parameters offer a straightforward interpretation of the nature of normalization. Within the receptive field, we found that neurons responding strongly to a specific orientation are preferentially normalized by other neurons that are highly active for similar orientations, rather than being normalized by all neurons as it is currently assumed by textbook models."}}

Recently, several methods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. However, since these models were evaluated on different downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR, which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may provide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video representations."}}
