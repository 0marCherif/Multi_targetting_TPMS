As a part of this trend, modern transportation systems are equipped with public WiFi devices to provide Internet access for passengers as people spend a large amount of time on public transportation in their daily life. However, one of the key issues in public WiFi spots is the privacy concern due to its open access nature. Existing works either studied location privacy risk in human traces or privacy leakage in private networks such as cellular networks based on the data from cellular carriers. To the best of our knowledge, none of these work has been focused on bus WiFi privacy based on large-scale real-world data. In this paper, to explore the privacy risk in bus WiFi systems, we focus on two key questions how likely bus WiFi users can be uniquely re-identified if partial usage information is leaked and how we can protect users from the leaked information. To understand the above questions, we conduct a case study in a large-scale bus WiFi system, which contains 20 million connection records and 78 million location records from 770 thousand bus WiFi users during a two-month period. Technically, we design two models for our uniqueness analyses and protection, i.e., a PB-FIND model to identify the probability a user can be uniquely re-identified from leaked information; a PB-HIDE model to protect users from potentially leaked information. Specifically, we systematically measure the user uniqueness on users' finger traces (i.e., connection URL and domain), foot traces (i.e., locations), and hybrid traces (i.e., both finger and foot traces). Our measurement results reveal (i) 97.8% users can be uniquely re-identified by 4 random domain records of their finger traces and 96.2% users can be uniquely re-identified by 5 random locations on buses; (ii) 98.1% users can be uniquely re-identified by only 2 random records if both their connection records and locations are leaked to attackers. Moreover, the evaluation results show our PB-HIDE algorithm protects more than 95% users from the potentially leaked information by inserting only 1.5% synthetic records in the original dataset to preserve their data utility."}}

In such cases, it is common to use feature importance as a tool to highlight significant factors contributing to that disease. As there are many existing methods for computing feature importance scores, understanding their relative merits is not trivial. Further, the diversity of scenarios in which they are used lead to different expectations from the feature importance scores. While it is common to make the distinction between local scores that focus on individual predictions and global scores that look at the contribution of a feature to the model, another important division distinguishes model scenarios, in which the goal is to understand predictions of a given model from natural scenarios, in which the goal is to understand a phenomenon such as a disease. We develop a set of axioms that represent the properties expected from a feature importance function in the natural scenario and prove that there exists only one function that satisfies all of them, the Marginal Contribution Feature Importance (MCI). We analyze this function for its theoretical and empirical properties and compare it to other feature importance scores. While our focus is the natural scenario, we suggest that our axiomatic approach could be carried out in other scenarios too."}}

Understanding the impact of urban anomalies on travel time is of great value for various applications such as urban planning, human mobility studies and navigation systems. Most existing studies on travel time have been focused on the total riding time between two locations on an individual transportation modality. However, passengers often take different modes of transportation, e.g., taxis, subways, buses or private vehicles, and a significant portion of the travel time is spent in the uncertain waiting. In this paper, we study the fine-grained travel time patterns in multiple transportation systems under the impact of urban anomalies. Specifically, (i) we investigate implicit components, including waiting and riding time, in multiple transportation systems; (ii) we measure the impact of real-world anomalies on travel time components; (iii) we design a learning-based model for travel time component prediction with anomalies. Different from existing studies, we implement and evaluate our measurement framework on multiple data sources including four city-scale transportation systems, which are (i) a 14-thousand taxicab network, (ii) a 13-thousand bus network, (iii) a 10-thousand private vehicle network, and (iv) an automatic fare collection system for a public transit network (i.e., subway and bus) with 5 million smart cards."}}
