This property relates closely to a non-degeneracy property for the Brownian rough path arising naturally from the uniqueness of signature problem in rough path theory. As an important consequence we conclude that quasi-surely, the Brownian rough path does not have any tree-like pieces and every sample path of Brownian motion is uniquely determined by its signature up to reparametrization."}}

However, there are security risks when applying only these authentication methods. For example, if the password is compromised, it is unlikely to determine whether the user entering the password is legitimate. In this paper, we subdivide biometric information into physiological and behavioral information, and we propose a novel user authentication system, RF-Ubia, which utilizes the lowcost radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to capture unique biological or behavioral information rooted in the user and can be used in two schemes for user authentication. Consisting of an array of nine passive tags and a commercial RFID reader, RF-Ubia provides double assurance for security of identity authentication by combining user information and biometric characteristics. It first verifies the user\u2019s password, and then identifies the biometric characteristics of the legitimate user. Due to the coupling effect among tags, any change in tag signal caused by the user\u2019s touch will affect other tag signals at the same time. Since each user has different fingertip impedance, their touch will cause unique tag signal changes. Therefore, by combining biometric information, the tag array will uniquely identify users. The evaluation results show that RF-Ubia achieves excellent authentication performance with an average recognition rate of 93.8%."}}

In many scenarios, coarse-grained system management of tag categories is more common than traditional system management of individual tags. Existing works on tag category management require knowing category IDs in advance, however, few protocols have been specially designed to obtain category IDs in multi-category RFID systems. In this paper, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CIP</i> , a time-efficient protocol specially designed to collect category IDs in multi-category RFID systems. The challenge in solving this problem is to avoid repeatedly collecting category IDs from multiple tags belonging to the same category. We address this challenge by squeezing tags in the same category into the same time slot and letting them reply to the reader simultaneously. Considering that the reader may receive signals from different tags in a slot, we exploit the Manchester coding to decode the aggregated signals. With this design, CIP collects each category ID only once and thus achieves high time efficiency by avoiding redundant identification of the same category ID. We further enhance CIP by utilizing the lightweight vectors to specify the order of tags\u2019 replying and avoid useless slots. Rigorous theoretical analysis is presented to optimize the performance of CIP and guidelines on how to set optimal parameters to minimize the overall execution time are given. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our protocols. The experimental results show that our protocols can significantly improve time efficiency by 67 percent when compared with the state-of-the-art solutions."}}

After RFID tags are deployed to make attached objects identifiable, a natural next step is to communicate with the tags and collect their information for the purpose of tracking tagged objects or monitoring their surroundings in real-time. In this paper, we study an under-investigated problem range detection in a commodity RFID system, which aims to check if there are any tags with the data between an upper and lower boundary in a time-efficient way. This is important especially in a large RFID system, which can help users quickly pinpoint the target tags (if any) and give an early warning to users for taking urgent actions and reducing the potential risk in the nascent stage. We propose two tailored protocols, selective query and range query, to achieve range detection within the scope of the C1G2 standard. The novelty is that, instead of querying each tag, we exploit the capability of C1G2-compatible selection and quickly separate target tags from others by silencing most of tags. The final result is that range query is able to achieve a range detection with only one query command. We implement the proposed protocols in commodity RFID systems, with no need for any hardware modifications. Extensive experiments show that range query is able to improve the time efficiency by an order of magnitude, compared with the baseline."}}

Many practical applications need to search a given set of tags (called  <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">wanted tags</i> ) to determine which of them are present in the system, which is usually called  <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tag searching</i> . Existing tag searching protocols suffer performance bottleneck and the time efficiency and need to be improved. The bottleneck stems from two factors. First, the existing methods validate the wanted tags in a random way due to the randomness of the hash function, which unavoidably generate many useless slots. Second, in order to achieve the predefined reliability requirement, the existing methods have to repeatedly validate target tags multiple times. In this paper, we design new tag searching techniques of compact exclusive validation that break through the existing performance bottleneck from two aspects. First, our protocols avoid slot waste. Different from random tag validation, our protocols validate tags orderly by mapping the wanted tags and the slots in a one-to-one manner, which makes the reader be able to validate tags in every slot. Second, our protocols avoid repeated tag responding. By combining two lightweight indicators, we rapidly filter out non-wanted tags so that there is no interference when validating the wanted tags. Hence, we need to validate each wanted tag only once, which avoids redundant validation and greatly improves time efficiency. Our protocols work with the assumption that the rough number of tags in the system can be obtained by using existing estimation algorithms, but they do not need to know exactly which tags are in the system. Theoretical analysis illustrates our methods achieve linear time complexity. Extensive experimental results show that, our best protocol can improve the time efficiency by up to 81 percent when compared with the-state-of-art solution."}}

Traditional single-task scheduling strategy is difficult to satisfy low-latency demand. This is because the task scheduler usually schedules tasks to a closer server, which leads to an increase in task latency when there are more tasks, which in turn leads to an increase in task rejection rate. In this paper, we propose an end-edge cooperative multi-tasks scheduling (MTS) strategy based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm. At first, we design a Software-Defined Networks controller algorithm to cluster task offload requests. Then, we set the scheduling priority for the multi-task clusters. At last, we minimize the total offloading cost of total tasks as the optimization goal to satisfy its delay. The results demonstrate that the strategy we proposed can effectively reduce the service cost of the system, and the processing delay of tasks, which improves the success rate of task processing."}}

However, recent progress shows that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which are crafted by adding small perturbations on normal samples that are imperceptible to human beings but can mislead the deep learning models to output incorrect results. Many adversarial attack models are proposed and many adversarial detection methods are developed to detect adversarial samples generated by these attack models. However, the evaluations of these detection methods are fragmented and scatter in separate literature, and the community still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the ability and performance of existing adversarial detection methods when facing different attack models on different datasets. In this paper, by using image classification as the example application scenario, we conduct a comprehensive study on the performance of five mainstream adversarial detection methods against five major attack models on four widely used benchmark datasets. We find that the detection accuracy of different methods interleaves for different attack models and dataset. Moreover, besides detection accuracy, we also evaluate the time efficiency of different detection methods. The findings reported in this paper can provide useful insights when designing systems to detect adversarial samples and act as a guideline to design new methods to detect adversarial samples."}}

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods only work well under the assumption of perfect environment. However, the real world environment is usually noisy. Inaccurate information obtained from a noisy environment will hinder the learning of the agent, and even lead to training failure. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training multiple robust agents in noisy environments. To tackle this problem, we proposed a new algorithm, multi-agent fault-tolerant reinforcement learning (MAFTRL). Our main idea is to establish the agent\u2019s own error detection mechanism and design the information communication medium between agents. The error detection mechanism is based on the autoencoder, which calculates the credibility of each agent\u2019s observation and effectively reduces the environmental noise. The communication medium based on the attention mechanism can significantly improve the ability of agents to extract effective information. Experimental results show that our approach accurately detects the error observation of the agent, which has good performance and strong robustness in both the traditional reliable environments and the noisy environments. Moreover, MAFTRL significantly outperforms the traditional methods in the noisy environments."}}

To accomplish a multi-stage task, agents have to achieve cooperation on different subtasks. Exploring the collaborative patterns of different subtasks and the sequence of completing the subtasks leads to an explosion in the search space, which poses great challenges to policy learning. Existing works designed for single-stage tasks where agents learn to cooperate only once usually suffer from low sample efficiency in multi-stage tasks as agents explore aimlessly. Inspired by human\u2019s improving cooperation through goal consistency, we propose Multi-Agent Goal Consistency (MAGIC) framework to improve sample efficiency for learning in multi-stage tasks. MAGIC adopts a goal-oriented actor-critic model to learn both local and global views of goal cognition, which helps agents understand the task at the goal level so that they can conduct targeted exploration accordingly. Moreover, to improve exploration efficiency, MAGIC employs two-level goal consistency training to drive agents to formulate a consistent goal cognition. Experimental results show that MAGIC significantly improves sample efficiency and facilitates cooperation among agents compared with state-of-art MARL algorithms in several challenging multistage tasks."}}

We propose two novel designs, including a two-step reliable feature selector and a multitask collaborative positioning model. First, we design a two-step reliable feature selector based on an access point (AP) confidence model and manifold learning, to help select the most representative and reliable fingerprint features. Second, we propose a multitask cooperative positioning model, which consists of a multiscale feature fusion module to adaptively fuse multiscale features and a multitask joint learning module to effectively constrain the cumulative error of multiscale position. Finally, based on the above two, we propose a reliable multibuilding and multifloor localization method (RMBMFL), which can achieve accurate and reliable location estimates with low computational complexity in a smart building complex.
