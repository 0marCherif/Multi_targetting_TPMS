However, achieving algorithmic fairness, which makes a model produce indiscriminative outcomes against protected groups, is still an unresolved problem. In this paper, we devise a systematic approach which reduces al- gorithmic biases via feature distillation for visual recogni- tion tasks, dubbed as MMD-based Fair Distillation (MFD). While the distillation technique has been widely used in general to improve the prediction accuracy, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no explicit work that also tries to improve fairness via distillation. Furthermore, We give a theoretical justification of our MFD on the effect of knowledge distillation and fairness. Throughout the exten- sive experiments, we show our MFD significantly mitigates the bias against specific minorities without any loss of the accuracy on both synthetic and real-world face datasets."}}

However, they have overlooked the impact of the knowledge transfer when the dataset in a certain task is biased - namely, when some unintended spurious correlations of the tasks are learned from the biased dataset. In that case, how would they affect learning future tasks or the knowledge already learned from the past tasks? In this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using one synthetic and two real-world datasets to answer the question from our empirical findings. Specifically, we first show through two-task CL experiments that standard CL methods, which are unaware of dataset bias, can transfer biases from one task to another, both forward and backward, and this transfer is exacerbated depending on whether the CL methods focus on the stability or the plasticity. We then present that the bias transfer also exists and even accumulate in longer sequences of tasks. Finally, we propose a simple, yet strong plug-in method for debiasing-aware continual learning, dubbed as Group-class Balanced Greedy Sampling (BGS). As a result, we show that our BGS can always reduce the bias of a CL model, with a slight loss of CL performance at most."}}

Although each of the learning schemes has its own strength in terms of applicability or performance, respectively, it is difficult for any method in the either category to be considered as a gold standard since their successful performances are typically limited to specific cases. To that end, we propose a principled method, dubbed as \\ours, which unifies the two learning schemes by incorporating a well-justified group fairness metric into the training objective using a class wise distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. We then develop an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the resulting objective by automatically producing the correct re-weights for each group. Our experiments show that FairDRO is scalable and easily adaptable to diverse applications, and consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets in terms of the accuracy-fairness trade-off, compared to recent strong baselines."}}

The inherent vulnerability of neural networks towards adversarial attacks and unfairness also calls for a robust method to remove or correct information in an instance-wise fashion, while retaining the predictive performance across remaining data. To this end, we define instance-wise unlearning, of which the goal is to delete information on a set of instances from a pre-trained model, by either misclassifying each instance away from its original prediction or relabeling the instance to a different label. We also propose two methods that reduce forgetting on the remaining data: 1) utilizing adversarial examples to overcome forgetting at the representation-level and 2) leveraging weight importance metrics to pinpoint network parameters guilty of propagating unwanted information. Both methods only require the pre-trained model and data instances to forget, allowing painless application to real-life settings where the entire training set is unavailable. Through extensive experimentation on various image classification benchmarks, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning given instances in both single-task and continual unlearning scenarios."}}

To address this challenge, we present SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer), a Swin Transformer architecture that can learn brain dynamics directly from 4D functional brain MRI data in a memory and computation-efficient manner. SwiFT achieves this by implementing a 4D window multi-head self-attention mechanism and absolute positional embeddings. We evaluate SwiFT using multiple largest-scale human functional brain imaging datasets in tasks such as predicting sex, age, and cognitive intelligence. Our experimental outcomes reveal that SwiFT consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models. To the best of our knowledge, SwiFT is the first Swin Transformer architecture that can process dimensional spatiotemporal brain functional data in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, due to the end-to-end learning capability, we also show that contrastive loss-based self-supervised pre-training of SwiFT is also feasible for achieving improved performance on a downstream task. We believe that our work holds substantial potential in facilitating scalable learning of functional brain imaging in neuroscience research by reducing the hurdles associated with applying Transformer models to high-dimensional fMRI."}}

To address this, several methods for enhancing the local smoothness of the gradient while training have been proposed for attaining robust feature attributions. However, the lack of considering the normalization of the attributions, which is essential in their visualizations, has been an obstacle to understanding and improving the robustness of feature attribution methods. In this paper, we provide new insights by taking such normalization into account. First, we show that for every non-negative homogeneous neural network, a naive l2-robust criterion for gradients is not normalization invariant, which means that two functions with the same normalized gradient can have different values. Second, we formulate a normalization invariant cosine distance-based criterion and derive its upper bound, which gives insight for why simply minimizing the Hessian norm at the input, as has been done in previous work, is not sufficient for attaining robust feature attribution. Finally, we propose to combine both l2 and cosine distance-based criteria as regularization terms to leverage the advantages of both in aligning the local gradient. As a result, we experimentally show that models trained with our method produce much more robust interpretations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 without significantly hurting the accuracy, compared to the recent baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to verify the robustness of interpretation on a larger-scale dataset beyond CIFAR-10, thanks to the computational efficiency of our method."}}

Despite their huge success in image classification, the number of images to be mix ed has not been elucidated in the literature: only the naive K-image expansion has been shown to lead to performance degradation. This study derives a new K-image mixing augmentation based on the stick-breaking process under Dirichlet prior distribution. We demonstrate the superiority of our K-image expansion augmentation over conventional two-image mixing augmentation methods through extensive experiments and analyses: 1) more robust and generalized classifiers; 2) a more desirable loss landscape shape; 3) better adversarial robustness. Moreover, we show that our probabilistic model can measure the sample-wise uncertainty and boost the efficiency for network architecture search by achieving a 7-fold reduction in the search time.

We first argue that the conventional loss form of continual learning which consists of single task-specific loss (for plasticity) and a regularizer (for stability) may not be ideal for contrastive loss based CSSL that focus on representation learning. Our reasoning is that, in contrastive learning based methods, the task-specific loss would suffer from decreasing diversity of negative samples and the regularizer may hinder learning new distinctive representations. To that end, we propose Sy-CON that consists of two losses (one for plasticity and the other for stability) with symmetric dependence on current and past models' negative sample embeddings. We argue our model can naturally find good trade-off between the plasticity and stability without any explicit hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating that MoCo-based implementation of Sy-CON loss achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art CSSL methods."}}
