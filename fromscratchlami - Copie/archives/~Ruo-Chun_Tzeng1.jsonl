While the majority of the literature has focused on analyzing the reconstruction error of low-rank matrices associated with the retrieved eigenvectors, in many applications one is interested in finding one vector with high Rayleigh quotient. In this paper we study the problem of approximating the top-eigenvector. Given a symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$, our goal is to find a vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ that approximates the leading eigenvector $\\mathbf{u}_1$ with high accuracy, as measured by the ratio $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}})=\\lambda_1^{-1}{\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T\\mathbf{A}\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}}/{\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}}$. We present a novel analysis of the randomized SVD algorithm of \\citet{halko2011finding} and derive tight bounds in many cases of interest. Notably, this is the first work that provides non-trivial bounds of $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}})$ for randomized SVD with any number of iterations. Our theoretical analysis is complemented with a thorough experimental study that confirms the efficiency and accuracy of the method."}}

The goal of the learner is to answer a query about the environment with a given level of certainty while minimizing her sampling budget. For this problem, instance-specific lower bounds on the expected sample complexity reveal the optimal proportions of arm draws an Oracle algorithm would apply. These proportions solve an optimization problem whose tractability strongly depends on the structural properties of the environment, but may be instrumental in the design of efficient learning algorithms. We devise Frank-Wolfe-based Sampling (FWS), a simple algorithm whose sample complexity matches the lower bounds for a wide class of pure exploration problems. The algorithm is computationally efficient as, to learn and track the optimal proportion of arm draws, it relies on a single iteration of Frank-Wolfe algorithm applied to the lower-bound optimization problem. We apply FWS to various pure exploration tasks, including best arm identification in unstructured, thresholded, linear, and Lipschitz bandits. Despite its simplicity, FWS is competitive compared to state-of-art algorithms."}}

Signed networks can be used to study a variety of social phenomena, such as mining polarized discussions in social media, or modeling relations of trust and distrust in online review platforms. In this paper we study the problem of detecting $k$ conflicting groups in a signed network. Our premise is that each group is positively connected internally and negatively connected with the other $k-1$ groups. An important aspect of our formulation is that we are not searching for a complete partition of the signed network, instead, we allow other nodes to be neutral with respect to the conflict structure we are searching. As a result, the problem we tackle differs from previously studied problems, such as correlation clustering and $k$-way partitioning. To solve the conflicting-group discovery problem, we derive a novel formulation in which each conflicting group is naturally characterized by the solution to the maximum discrete Rayleigh's quotient (\\maxdrq) problem. We present two spectral methods for finding approximate solutions to the \\maxdrq problem, which we analyze theoretically. Our experimental evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our methods find solutions of higher quality, are faster, and recover ground truth conflicting groups with higher accuracy."}}

In this paper, we consider the possibility of detecting critical structures by a graph embedding model. We propose Ego-CNN to embed graph, which works in a local-to-global manner to take advantages of CNNs that gradually expanding the detectable local regions on the graph as the network depth increases. Critical structures can be detected if Ego-CNN is combined with a supervised task model. We show that Ego-CNN is (1) competitive to state-of-the-art graph embeddings models, (2) can nicely work with CNNs visualization techniques to show the detected structures, and (3) is efficient and can incorporate with scale-free priors, which commonly occurs in social network datasets, to further improve the training efficiency."}}
