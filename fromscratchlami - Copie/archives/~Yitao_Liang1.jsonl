It predicts missing links by reasoning on existing facts. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is one of the most popular methods to address this problem. It embeds entities and relations into low-dimensional vectors and uses the learned entity/relation embeddings to predict missing facts. However, KGE only uses zeroth-order (propositional) logic to encode existing triplets (e.g., ``Alice is Bob's wife.\"); it is unable to leverage first-order (predicate) logic to represent generally applicable logical \\textbf{rules} (e.g., ``$\\forall x,y \\colon x ~\\text{is}~ y\\text{'s wife} \\rightarrow y ~\\text{is}~ x\\text{'s husband}$''). On the other hand, traditional rule-based KG reasoning methods usually rely on hard logical rule inference, making it brittle and hardly competitive with KGE. In this paper, we propose RulE, a novel and principled framework to represent and model logical rules and triplets. RulE jointly represents entities, relations and logical rules in a unified embedding space. By learning an embedding for each logical rule, RulE can perform logical rule inference in a soft way and give a confidence score to each grounded rule, similar to how KGE gives each triplet a confidence score. Compared to KGE alone, RulE allows injecting prior logical rule information into the embedding space, which improves the generalization of knowledge graph embedding. Besides, the learned confidence scores of rules improve the logical rule inference process by softly controlling the contribution of each rule, which alleviates the brittleness of logic. We evaluate our method with link prediction tasks. Experimental results on multiple benchmark KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of RulE."}}

Given a scene context (e.g., 3D scan), SQA3D requires the tested agent to first understand its situation (position, orientation, etc.) in the 3D scene as described by text, then reason about its surrounding environment and answer a question under that situation. Based upon 650 scenes from ScanNet, we provide a dataset centered around 6.8k unique situations, along with 20.4k descriptions and 33.4k diverse reasoning questions for these situations. These questions examine a wide spectrum of reasoning capabilities for an intelligent agent, ranging from spatial relation comprehension to commonsense understanding, navigation, and multi-hop reasoning. SQA3D imposes a significant challenge to current multi-modal especially 3D reasoning models. We evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches and find that the best one only achieves an overall score of 47.20%, while amateur human participants can reach 90.06%. We believe SQA3D could facilitate future embodied AI research with stronger situation understanding and reasoning capability."}}

We propose Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR) to tackle this deficiency. The core representation of NSR is a Grounded Symbol System (GSS) with combina- torial syntax and semantics, which entirely emerges from training data. Akin to the neuroscience studies suggesting separate brain systems for perceptual, syntactic, and semantic processing, NSR implements analogous separate modules of neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic reasoning, which are jointly learned by a deduction-abduction algorithm. We prove that NSR is expressive enough to model various sequence-to-sequence tasks. Superior systematic generalization is achieved via the inductive biases of equivariance and recursiveness embedded in NSR. In experiments, NSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in three benchmarks from different domains: SCAN for semantic parsing, PCFG for string manipulation, and HINT for arithmetic reasoning. Specifically, NSR achieves 100% generalization accuracy on SCAN and PCFG and outperforms state-of-the-art models on HINT by about 23%. Our NSR demonstrates stronger generalization than pure neural networks due to its symbolic representation and inductive biases. NSR also demonstrates better transferability than existing neural-symbolic approaches due to less domain-specific knowledge required."}}

Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) tackles this problem by learning transferable policies that support few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks. Despite recent advances in meta-RL, most existing methods require the access to the environmental reward function of new tasks to infer the task objective, which is not realistic in many practical applications. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of few-shot adaptation in the context of human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. We develop a meta-RL algorithm that enables fast policy adaptation with preference-based feedback. The agent can adapt to new tasks by querying human's preference between behavior trajectories instead of using per-step numeric rewards. By extending techniques from information theory, our approach can design query sequences to maximize the information gain from human interactions while tolerating the inherent error of non-expert human oracle. In experiments, we extensively evaluate our method, Adaptation with Noisy OracLE (ANOLE), on a variety of meta-RL benchmark tasks and demonstrate substantial improvement over baseline algorithms in terms of both feedback efficiency and error tolerance."}}
