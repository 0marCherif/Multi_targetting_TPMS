However, translating this success to semantic segmentation is not trivial, because this dense prediction task requires not only accurate semantic understanding but also fine shape delineation and existing vision-language models are trained with image-level language descriptions. To bridge this gap, we pursue \\textbf{shape-aware} zero-shot semantic segmentation in this study. Inspired by classical spectral methods in the image segmentation literature, we propose to leverage the eigen vectors of Laplacian matrices constructed with self-supervised pixel-wise features to promote shape-awareness. Despite that this simple and effective technique does not make use of the masks of seen classes at all, we demonstrate that it out-performs a state-of-the-art shape-aware formulation that aligns ground truth and predicted edges during training. We also delve into the performance gains achieved on different datasets using different backbones and draw several interesting and conclusive observations: the benefits of promoting shape-awareness highly relates to mask compactness and language embedding locality. Finally, our method sets new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation on both Pascal and COCO, with significant margins.

However, layout estimation using point clouds (PCs) still suffers from data scarcity due to annotation difficulty. As such, we address the semi-supervised setting of this task based upon the idea of model exponential moving averaging. But adapting this scheme to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for PC-based layout estimation is not straightforward. To this end, we define a quad set matching strategy and several consistency losses based upon metrics tailored for layout quads. Besides, we propose a new online pseudo-label harvesting algorithm that decomposes the distribution of a hybrid distance measure between quads and PC into two components. This technique does not need manual threshold selection and intuitively encourages quads to align with reliable layout points. Surprisingly, this framework also works for the fully-supervised setting, achieving a new SOTA on the ScanNet benchmark. Last but not least, we also push the semi-supervised setting to the realistic omni-supervised setting, demonstrating significantly promoted performance on a newly annotated ARKitScenes testing set. Our codes, data and models are released in this repository."}}

We propose a retrieval-augmentation method named ReCross that takes a few unlabelled examples as queries to retrieve a small subset of upstream data and uses them to update the multi-task model for better generalization. ReCross is a straightforward yet effective retrieval method that combines both efficient dense retrieval and effective pair-wise reranking.

However, current methods with fully-supervised models require manually annotated point-wise supervision which is extremely user-unfriendly and time-consuming to obtain. As such, training 3D scene parsing models with sparse supervision is an intriguing alternative. We term this task as data-efficient 3D scene parsing and propose an effective two-stage framework named VIBUS to resolve it by exploiting the enormous unlabeled points. In the first stage, we perform self-supervised representation learning on unlabeled points with the proposed Viewpoint Bottleneck loss function. The loss function is derived from an information bottleneck objective imposed on scenes under different viewpoints, making the process of representation learning free of degradation and sampling. In the second stage, pseudo labels are harvested from the sparse labels based on uncertainty-spectrum modeling. By combining data-driven uncertainty measures and 3D mesh spectrum measures (derived from normal directions and geodesic distances), a robust local affinity metric is obtained. Finite gamma/beta mixture models are used to decompose category-wise distributions of these measures, leading to automatic selection of thresholds. We evaluate VIBUS on the public benchmark ScanNet and achieve state-of-the-art results on both validation set and online test server. Ablation studies show that both Viewpoint Bottleneck and uncertainty-spectrum modeling bring significant improvements.

The input is a 3D indoor scene mesh and several phrases that describe the target scene. Firstly, 3D vertex coordinates are mapped to RGB residues by a multi-layer perceptron. Secondly, colored 3D meshes are differentiablly rendered into 2D images, via a viewpoint sampling strategy tailored for indoor scenes. Thirdly, rendered 2D images are compared to phrases, via pre-trained vision-language models. Lastly, errors are back-propagated to the multi-layer perceptron to update vertex colors corresponding to certain semantic categories. We did large-scale qualitative analyses and A/B user tests, with the public ScanNet and SceneNN datasets. We demonstrate: (1) visually pleasing results that are potentially useful for multimedia applications. (2) rendering 3D indoor scenes from viewpoints consistent with human priors is important. (3) incorporating semantics significantly improve style transfer quality. (4) an HSV regularization term leads to results that are more consistent with inputs and generally rated better.
