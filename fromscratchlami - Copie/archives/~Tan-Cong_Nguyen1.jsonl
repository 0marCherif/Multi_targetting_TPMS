In most of\nthe previous challenges, it is unlikely for 2D CNNs to be comparable with other 3D CNNs since 2D models can hardly capture temporal information. In light of that, we propose using the recent state-of-the-art technique in video object segmentation, combining it with other semi-supervised training techniques to leverage the extensive unlabeled data. Moreover, we introduce a way to generate pseudo-labeled data that is both plausible and consistent for further retraining by using uncertainty estimation. Overall, our method achieves 0.7841 DSC on the validation set of FLARE22."}}
