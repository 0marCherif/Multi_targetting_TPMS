How- ever, GANs are known to be hard to train due to their bilevel objective, which leads to the problems of convergence, mode collapse, and gradient vanishing. In this paper, we propose a new generative model called the generative adversarial NTK (GA-NTK) that has a single-level objective. The GA-NTK keeps the spirit of adversarial learning (which helps generate plausible data) while avoiding the training difficulties of GANs. This is done by modeling the discriminator as a Gaussian process with a neural tangent kernel (NTK-GP) whose training dynam- ics can be completely described by a closed-form formula. We analyze the conver- gence behavior of GA-NTK trained by gradient descent and give some sufficient conditions for convergence. We also conduct extensive experiments to study the advantages and limitations of GA-NTK and propose some techniques that make GA-NTK more practical."}}
