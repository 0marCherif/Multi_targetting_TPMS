First of all, we convert TSF into a more inclusive problem called tensor completion with arbitrary sampling (TCAS), which is to restore a tensor from a subset of its entries sampled in an arbitrary manner. While it is known that, in the framework of Tucker low-rankness, it is theoretically impossible to identify the target tensor based on some arbitrarily selected entries, in this work we shall show that TCAS is indeed tackleable in the light of a new concept called convolutional low-rankness, which is a generalization of the well-known Fourier sparsity. Then we introduce a convex program termed Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and we prove that CNNM succeeds in solving TCAS as long as a sampling condition\u2014which depends on the convolution rank of the target tensor\u2014is obeyed. This theory provides a meaningful answer to the fundamental question of what is the minimum sampling size needed for making a given number of forecasts. Experiments on univariate time series, images and videos show encouraging results."}}

However, such power comes at a cost: it incurs a huge computation burden and heavy memory footprint as pairwise token interaction across all spatial locations is computed. A series of works attempt to alleviate this problem by introducing handcrafted and content-agnostic sparsity into attention, such as restricting the attention operation to be inside local windows, axial stripes, or dilated windows. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a novel dynamic sparse attention via bi-level routing to enable a more flexible allocation of computations with content awareness. Specifically, for a query, irrelevant key-value pairs are first filtered out at a coarse region level, and then fine-grained token-to-token attention is applied in the union of remaining candidate regions (\\ie, routed regions). We provide a simple yet effective implementation of the proposed bi-level routing attention, which utilizes the sparsity to save both computation and memory while involving only GPU-friendly dense matrix multiplications. Built with the proposed bi-level routing attention, a new general vision transformer, named BiFormer, is then presented. As BiFormer attends to a small subset of relevant tokens in a \\textbf{query adaptive} manner without distraction from other irrelevant ones, it enjoys both good performance and high computational efficiency, especially in dense prediction tasks. Empirical results across several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our design.

Our core observation is that the oscillating pseudo targets undermine the training of an accurate semi-supervised detector. It not only inject noise into student training but also lead to severe overfitting on the classification task. Therefore, we propose a systematic solution, termed Consistent-Teacher, to reduce the inconsistency. First, adaptive anchor assignment~(ASA) substitutes the static IoU-based strategy, which enables the student network to be resistant to noisy pseudo bounding boxes; Then we calibrate the subtask predictions by designing a 3D feature alignment module~(FAM-3D). It allows each classification feature to adaptively query the optimal feature vector for the regression task at arbitrary scales and locations. Lastly, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dynamically revises the score threshold of the pseudo-bboxes, which stabilizes the number of ground-truths at an early stage and remedies the unreliable supervision signal during training. Consistent-Teacher provides strong results on a large range of SSOD evaluations. It achieves 40.0 mAP with ResNet-50 backbone given only 10\\% of annotated MS-COCO data, which surpasses previous baselines using pseudo labels by around 3 mAP. When trained on fully annotated MS-COCO with additional unlabeled data, the performance further increases to 47.2 mAP. Our code will be open-sourced soon."}}
{"id": "GmjwnzduXzf", "cdate": 1663849813526, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Grassmannian Class Representation in Deep Learning", "abstract": "We generalize the class representative vector found in deep classification networks to linear subspaces and show that the new formulation enables the simultaneous enhancement of the inter-class discrimination and intra-class feature variation. Traditionally, the logit is computed by the inner product between a feature and the class vector. In our modeling, classes are subspaces and the logit is defined as the norm of the projection from a feature onto the subspace. Since the set of subspaces forms Grassmann manifolds, finding the optimal subspace representation for classes is to optimize the loss on a Grassmannian. We integrate the Riemannian SGD into existing deep learning frameworks such that the class subspaces in a Grassmannian are jointly optimized with other model parameters in Euclidean. Compared to the vector form, subspaces have two appealing properties: they can be multi-dimensional and they are scaleless. Empirically, we reveal that these distinct characteristics improve various tasks. (1) Image classification. The new formulation brings the top-1 accuracy of ResNet50-D on ImageNet-1K from 78.04% to 79.37% using the standard augmentation in 100 training epochs. This confirms that the representative capability of subspaces is more powerful than vectors. (2) Feature transfer. Subspaces provide freedom for features to vary and we observed that the intra-class variability of features increases when the subspace dimensions are larger. Consequently, the quality of features is better for downstream tasks. The average transfer accuracy across 6 datasets improves from 77.98% to 80.12% compared to the strong baseline of vanilla softmax. (3) Long-tail classification. The scaleless property of subspaces benefits classification in the long-tail scenario and improves the accuracy of ImageNet-LT from 46.83% to 48.94% compared to the standard formulation. With these encouraging results, we believe that more applications could benefit from the Grassmannian class representation. Codes will be released."}}

However, the immense diversity of the OOD examples makes such methods fragile. There are OOD samples that are easy to identify in the feature space while hard to distinguish in the logit space and vice versa. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching (ViM), which combines the class-agnostic score from feature space and the In-Distribution (ID) class-dependent logits. Specifically, an additional logit representing the virtual OOD class is generated from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and then matched with the original logits by a constant scaling. The probability of this virtual logit after softmax is the indicator of OOD-ness. To facilitate the evaluation of large-scale OOD detection in academia, we create a new OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K, which is human-annotated and is 8.8x the size of existing datasets. We conducted extensive experiments, including CNNs and vision transformers, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ViM score. In particular, using the BiT-S model, our method gets an average AUROC 90.91% on four difficult OOD benchmarks, which is 4% ahead of the best baseline.

Intriguingly, we observe that such a simple pipeline already achieves competitive results against recent advanced works, when transferred to our segmentation scenario. Its success heavily relies on the manual design of strong data augmentations, however, which may be limited and inadequate to explore a broader perturbation space. Motivated by this, we propose an auxiliary feature perturbation stream as a supplement, leading to an expanded perturbation space. On the other, to sufficiently probe original image-level augmentations, we present a dual-stream perturbation technique, enabling two strong views to be simultaneously guided by a common weak view. Consequently, our overall Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations approach (UniMatch) surpasses all existing methods significantly across all evaluation protocols on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks. Its superiority is also demonstrated in remote sensing interpretation and medical image analysis. We hope our reproduced FixMatch and our results can inspire more future works.

We argue that such a paradigm causes several problems that impede the progress of the field. For instance, bounding box-based labels in current datasets usually contain redundant classes like hairs, and leave out background information that is crucial to the understanding of context. In this work, we introduce panoptic scene graph generation (PSG), a new problem task that requires the model to generate a more comprehensive scene graph representation based on panoptic segmentations rather than rigid bounding boxes. A high-quality PSG dataset, which contains 49k well-annotated overlapping images from COCO and Visual Genome, is created for the community to keep track of its progress. For benchmarking, we build four two-stage baselines, which are modified from classic methods in SGG, and two one-stage baselines called PSGTR and PSGFormer, which are based on the efficient Transformer-based detector, i.e., DETR. While PSGTR uses a set of queries to directly learn triplets, PSGFormer separately models the objects and relations in the form of queries from two Transformer decoders, followed by a prompting-like relation-object matching mechanism. In the end, we share insights on open challenges and future directions."}}
