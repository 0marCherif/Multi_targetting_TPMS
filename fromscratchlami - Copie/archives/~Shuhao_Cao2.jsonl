A real-time reconstruction is achieved by evaluating the learned inverse operator between carefully designed data and the reconstructed images. An effort is made to give a specific example to a fundamental question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks. \nThis research shall strengthen the insights that, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, the attention mechanism offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.

A background body-fitted mesh is generated initially. On those interface elements, virtual element spaces are constructed as solution spaces to local interface problems, and exact sequences can be established for these new spaces involving discontinuous coefficients. The discontinuous coefficients of interface problems are recast as Hodge star operators that are the key to project immersed virtual functions to classic immersed finite element (IFE) functions for computing numerical solutions. An a priori convergence analysis is established robust with respect to the interface location. The proposed method is capable of handling more complicated interface element configuration and provides better performance than the conventional penalty-type IFE method for the $$\\mathbf{H}({\\text {curl}})$$ H ( curl ) -interface problem arising from Maxwell equations. It also brings a connection between various methods such as body-fitted methods, IFE methods, virtual element methods, etc."}}

The difficulty of constructing elements with certain conformity to the quad\u2013curl problems has been greatly reduced. For convex domains, where the regularity assumption holds for Stokes equation, the approximation to the curl of the true solution has quadratic order of convergence and first order for the energy norm. If the solution shows singularity, an a posterior error estimator is developed and a separate marking adaptive finite element procedure is proposed, together with its convergence proved. Both the a priori and a posteriori error analysis are supported by the numerical examples."}}

Inspired by the full bootstrap algebraic multigrid setup algorithm that includes an AMG eigensolver, we illustrate how the algorithm can be simplified for the case of a discretized partial differential equation, thereby developing a bootstrap geometric multigrid (BMG) approach. We illustrate numerically the efficacy of the BMG method for (1) recovering eigenvalues having large multiplicity, (2) computing interior eigenvalues, and (3) approximating shifted indefinite eigenvalue problems. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the basic components and ideas behind the success of the overall bootstrap multigrid approach. For completeness, we present a simplified error analysis of a two-grid bootstrap algorithm for the Laplace\u2013Beltrami eigenvalue problem."}}

An effort is put together to explain the heuristics of, and to improve the efficacy of the attention mechanism. By employing the operator approximation theory in Hilbert spaces, it is demonstrated for the first time that the softmax normalization in the scaled dot-product attention is sufficient but not necessary. Without softmax, the approximation capacity of a linearized Transformer variant can be proved to be comparable to a Petrov-Galerkin projection layer-wise, and the estimate is independent with respect to the sequence length. A new layer normalization scheme mimicking the Petrov-Galerkin projection is proposed to allow a scaling to propagate through attention layers, which helps the model achieve remarkable accuracy in operator learning tasks with unnormalized data. Finally, we present three operator learning experiments, including the viscid Burgers' equation, an interface Darcy flow, and an inverse interface coefficient identification problem. The newly proposed simple attention-based operator learner, Galerkin Transformer, shows significant improvements in both training cost and evaluation accuracy over its softmax-normalized counterparts."}}

The error analysis is then extended to a special class of anisotropic elements with high aspect ratio originating from a body-fitted mesh generator, which uses straight lines to cut a shape regular background mesh. Lastly, some commonly used tools for triangular elements are revisited for polygonal elements to give an in-depth view of these estimates' dependence on shapes."}}
