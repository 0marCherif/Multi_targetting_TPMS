In one of the two existing approaches, evolutionarily-related sequences to a query protein drive the modelling process, without any property measurements from the laboratory. In the other, a set of protein variants of interest are assayed, and then a supervised regression model is estimated with the assay-labelled data. Although a handful of recent methods have shown promise in combining the evolutionary and supervised approaches, this hybrid problem has not been examined in depth, leaving it unclear how practitioners should proceed, and how method developers should build on existing work. Herein, we present a systematic assessment of methods for protein fitness prediction when evolutionary and assay-labelled data are available. We find that a simple baseline approach we introduce is competitive with and often outperforms more sophisticated methods. Moreover, our simple baseline is plug-and-play with a wide variety of established methods, and does not add any substantial computational burden. Our analysis highlights the importance of systematic evaluations and sufficient baselines."}}

However, identifying the parameters of a linear dynamical system is a venerable task, permitting provably efficient solutions only in special cases. This work shows that the eigenspectrum of unknown linear dynamics can be identified without full system identification. We analyze a computationally efficient and provably convergent algorithm to estimate the eigenvalues of the state-transition matrix in a linear dynamical system. When applied to time series clustering, our algorithm can efficiently cluster multi-dimensional time series with temporal offsets and varying lengths, under the assumption that the time series are generated from linear dynamical systems. Evaluating our algorithm on both synthetic data and real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, we see improvements in clustering quality over existing baselines."}}

Recent work has studied multidimensional k-SUM in F_p^d, where the best known algorithm takes time \\tilde O(n^{\\ceil{k/2}}). Bhattacharyya et al. [ICS 2011] proved a min(2^{\\Omega(d)},n^{\\Omega(k)}) lower bound for k-SUM in F_p^d under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We give a more refined lower bound under the standard k-SUM conjecture: for sufficiently large p, k-SUM in F_p^d requires time Omega(n^{k/2-o(1)}) if k is even, and Omega(n^{\\ceil{k/2}-2k(log k)/(log p)-o(1)}) if k is odd. For a special case of the multidimensional problem, bounded monotone d-dimensional 3SUM, Chan and Lewenstein [STOC 2015] gave a surprising \\tilde O(n^{2-2/(d+13)}) algorithm using additive combinatorics. We show this algorithm is essentially optimal. To be more precise, bounded monotone d-dimensional 3SUM requires time Omega(n^{2-\\frac{4}{d}-o(1)}) under the standard 3SUM conjecture, and time Omega(n^{2-\\frac{2}{d}-o(1)}) under the so-called strong 3SUM conjecture. Thus, even though one might hope to further exploit the structural advantage of monotonicity, no substantial improvements beyond those obtained by Chan and Lewenstein are possible for bounded monotone d-dimensional 3SUM."}}
