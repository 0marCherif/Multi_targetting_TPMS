A neural network is formulated so that the rate model satisfies the plug flow reactor design equation. The model is then employed to understand the variation of reactant and product composition within the reactor for the reference catalyst Mn\u2013Na2WO4/SiO2 at different temperatures and to identify new catalysts and combinations of known catalysts that would increase yield and selectivity relative to the reference catalyst. The model revealed that methane is converted in the first half of the catalyst bed, while the second part largely consolidates the products (i.e. increases ethylene to ethane ratio). A screening study of ${\\geqslant}3400$ combinations of pairs of previously studied catalysts of the form M1(M2)$_{1-2}$M3Ox/support (where M1, M2 and M3 are metals) revealed that a reactor configuration comprising two sequential catalyst beds leads to synergistic effects resulting in increased yield of C2 compared to the reference catalyst at identical conditions and contact time. Finally, an expanded screening study of 7400 combinations (comprising previously studied metals but with several new permutations) revealed multiple catalyst choices with enhanced yields of C2 products. This study demonstrates the value of learning a deep neural network model for the instantaneous reaction rate directly from high-throughput data and represents a first step in constraining a data-driven reaction model to satisfy domain information."}}

Current \\textit{pair-based} and \\textit{proxy-based} methods on DML focus on reducing the distance between similar samples while expanding the distance of dissimilar ones. However, we reveal that shrinking the distance between similar samples may distort the feature space, increasing the distance between points of the same class region and, therefore, harming the generalization of the model. Traditional regularization terms (such as $L_2$-norm on weights) cannot be adopted to solve this issue as they are based on linear projection. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the structure of normalizing flow as the deep metric layer and calculate the determinant of the Jacobi Matrix as the regularization term. At last, we conduct experiments on several \\textit{pair-based} and \\textit{proxy-based} algorithms that demonstrate the benefits of our method.\n\n"}}
