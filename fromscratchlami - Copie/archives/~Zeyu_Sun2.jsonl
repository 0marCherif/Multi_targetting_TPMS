The latest studies in this field mainly depend on deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network. However, these methods may not generate high-quality and readable code comments due to the long-term dependence problem, which means that the code blocks used to summarize information are far from each other. Owing to the long-term dependence problem, these methods forget the previous input data\u2019s feature information during the training process. In this article, to solve the long-term dependence problem and extract both the text and structure information from the program code, we propose a novel improved-Transformer-based comment generation method, named SeTransformer. Specifically, the SeTransformer utilizes the code tokens and an abstract syntax tree (AST) of programs to extract information as the inputs, and then, it leverages the self-attention mechanism to analyze the text and structural features of code simultaneously. Experimental results based on public corpus gathered from large-scale open-source projects show that our method can significantly outperform five state-of-the-art baselines (such as Hybrid-DeepCom and AST-attendgru). Furthermore, we also conduct a questionnaire survey for developers, and the results show that the SeTransformer can generate higher quality comments than those of other baselines."}}

While promising for declarative languages, these approaches achieve much poorer performance on datasets for imperative languages. Since a declarative language is typically embedded in an imperative language (i.e., the turducken-style programming) in real-world software development, the promising results on declarative languages can hardly lead to significant reduction of manual software development efforts. In this paper, we define a new code generation task: given a natural language comment, this task aims to generate a program in a base imperative language with an embedded declarative language. To our knowledge, this is the first turducken-style code generation task. For this task, we present Lyra: a dataset in Python with embedded SQL. This dataset contains 2,000 carefully annotated database manipulation programs from real usage projects. Each program is paired with both a Chinese comment and an English comment. In our experiment, we adopted Transformer, BERT-style, and GPT-style models as baselines. In the best setting, GPT-style model can achieve 24% and 25.5% AST exact matching accuracy using Chinese and English comments, respectively. Therefore, we believe that Lyra provides a new challenge for code generation. Yet, overcoming this challenge may significantly boost the applicability of code generation techniques for real-world software development."}}

However, machine translation systems are far from perfect. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed several approaches to testing machine translation. A promising trend among these approaches is to use word replacement, where only one word in the original sentence is replaced with another word to form a sentence pair. However, precise control of the impact of word replacement remains an outstanding issue in these approaches. To address this issue, we propose CAT, a novel word-replacement-based approach, whose basic idea is to identify word replacement with controlled impact (referred to as isotopic replacement). To achieve this purpose, we use a neural-based language model to encode the sentence context, and design a neural-network-based algorithm to evaluate context-aware semantic similarity between two words. Furthermore, similar to TransRepair, a state-of-the-art word-replacement-based approach, CAT also provides automatic fixing of revealed bugs without model retraining. Our evaluation on Google Translate and Transformer indicates that CAT achieves significant improvements over TransRepair. In particular, 1) CAT detects seven more types of bugs than TransRepair; 2) CAT detects 129% more translation bugs than TransRepair; 3) CAT repairs twice more bugs than TransRepair, many of which may bring serious consequences if left unfixed; and 4) CAT has better efficiency than TransRepair in input generation (0.01s v.s. 0.41s) and comparable efficiency with TransRepair in bug repair (1.92s v.s. 1.34s)."}}

However, when processing context-free languages, embedding grammar rules with word embedding loses two types of information. One is the structural relationship between the grammar rules, and the other one is the content information of the rule definition. In this paper, we make the first attempt to learn a grammar-preserving rule embedding. We first introduce a novel graph structure to represent the context-free grammar. Then, we apply a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to extract the structural information and use a gating layer to integrate content information. We conducted experiments on six widely-used benchmarks containing four context-free languages. The results show that our approach improves the accuracy of the base model by 0.8 to 6.4 percentage points. Furthermore, Grape also achieves 1.6 F1 score improvement on the method naming task which shows the generality of our approach."}}

However, graphs with unattributed nodes widely exist in real-world applications (e.g., anonymized social networks). Previous GNNs either assign random labels to nodes (which introduces artefacts to the GNN) or assign one embedding to all nodes (which fails to explicitly distinguish one node from another). Further, when these GNNs are applied to unattributed node classification problems, they have an undesired equivariance property, which are fundamentally unable to address the data with multiple possible outputs. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of existing approaches to node classification problems. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a generalized equivariance property and a Preferential Labeling technique that satisfies the desired property asymptotically. Experimental results show that we achieve high performance in several unattributed node classification tasks."}}

To alleviate human efforts in writing commit messages, researchers have proposed various automated techniques to generate commit messages, including template-based, information retrieval-based, and learning-based techniques. Although promising, previous techniques have limited effectiveness due to their coarse-grained code change representations. This work proposes a novel commit message generation technique, FIRA, which first represents code changes via fine-grained graphs and then learns to generate commit messages automatically. Different from previous techniques, FIRA represents the code changes with fine-grained graphs, which explicitly describe the code edit operations between the old version and the new version, and code tokens at different granularities (i.e., sub-tokens and integral tokens). Based on the graph-based representation, FIRA generates commit messages by a generation model, which includes a graph-neural-network-based encoder and a transformer-based decoder. To make both sub-tokens and integral tokens as available ingredients for commit message generation, the decoder is further incorporated with a novel dual copy mechanism. We further perform an extensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of FIRA. Our quantitative results show that FIRA outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR; and our ablation analysis further shows that major components in our technique both positively contribute to the effectiveness of FIRA. In addition, we further perform a human study to evaluate the quality of generated commit messages from the perspective of developers, and the results consistently show the effectiveness of FIRA over the compared techniques."}}

Recent APR techniques use deep learning, particularly the encoder-decoder architecture, to generate patches. Though existing DL-based APR approaches have proposed different encoder architectures, the decoder remains to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of tokens one by one to replace the faulty statement. This decoder has multiple limitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs, 2) inefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to generate project-specific identifiers. In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder with placeholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects: 1) Recoder generates edits rather than modified code, allowing efficient representation of small edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided, with the novel provider/decider architecture to ensure the syntactic correctness of the patched program and accurate generation; 3) Recoder generates placeholders that could be instantiated as project-specific identifiers later. We conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2, 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, 297 bugs from IntroClassJava and 40 bugs from QuixBugs. Our results show that Recoder repairs 53 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves 26.2% (11 bugs) improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach for single-hunk bugs (TBar). Importantly, to our knowledge, Recoder is the first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed the traditional APR approaches on this benchmark. Furthermore, Recoder repairs 19 bugs on the additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, which is 137.5% (11 bugs) more than TBar and 850% (17 bugs) more than SimFix. Recoder also achieves 775% (31 bugs) and 30.8% (4 bugs) improvement on IntroClassJava and QuixBugs over the baselines respectively. These results suggest that Recoder has better generalizability than existing APR approaches."}}

However, existing techniques often utilize coverage in an oversimplified way by abstracting detailed coverage into numbers of tests or boolean vectors, thus limiting their effectiveness in practice. In this work, we present a novel coverage-based fault localization technique, GRACE, which fully utilizes detailed coverage information with graph-based representation learning. Our intuition is that coverage can be regarded as connective relationships between tests and program entities, which can be inherently and integrally represented by a graph structure: with tests and program entities as nodes, while with coverage and code structures as edges. Therefore, we first propose a novel graph-based representation to reserve all detailed coverage information and fine-grained code structures into one graph. Then we leverage Gated Graph Neural Network to learn valuable features from the graph-based coverage representation and rank program entities in a listwise way. Our evaluation on the widely used benchmark Defects4J (V1.2.0) shows that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coverage-based fault localization: GRACE localizes 195 bugs within Top-1 whereas the best compared technique can at most localize 166 bugs within Top-1. We further investigate the impact of each GRACE component and find that they all positively contribute to GRACE. In addition, our results also demonstrate that GRACE has learnt essential features from coverage, which are complementary to various information used in existing learning-based fault localization. Finally, we evaluate GRACE in the cross-project prediction scenario on extra 226 bugs from Defects4J (V2.0.0), and find that GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art coverage-based techniques."}}
