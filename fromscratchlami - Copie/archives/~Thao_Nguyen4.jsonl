Real-life makeups are diverse and wild, which cover not only color-changing but also patterns, such as stickers, blushes, and jewelries. However, existing works overlooked the latter components and confined makeup transfer to color manipulation, focusing only on light makeup styles. In this work, we propose a holistic makeup transfer framework that can handle all the mentioned makeup components. It consists of an improved color transfer branch and a novel pattern transfer branch to learn all makeup properties, including color, shape, texture, and location. To train and evaluate such a system, we also introduce new makeup datasets for real and synthetic extreme makeup. Experimental results show that our framework achieves the state of the art performance on both light and extreme makeup styles."}}

We propose a method that tackles this problem from two directions: (1) enhancing the blurry frames, and (2) treating the blurry frames as missing values and estimate them by interpolation. These approaches are complementary to each other, and their combination outperforms individual ones. We also introduce a novel module that leverages the structure of faces for finding positional offsets between video frames. This module can be integrated into the processing pipelines of both approaches, improving the quality of the final outcome. Experiments on three real and synthetically generated blurry video datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results."}}
