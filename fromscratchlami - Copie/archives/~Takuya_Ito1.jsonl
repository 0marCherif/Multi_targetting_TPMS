However, there is a conceptual gap between the use and interpretation of these measures between the human neuroimaging and non-human primate electrophysiology literature. For example, in the human neuroimaging literature, \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d is often used to refer to correlated activity, while in the non-human primate electrophysiology literature, the equivalent term is \u201cnoise correlation\u201d. In an effort to unify these two perspectives under a single theoretical framework, we provide empirical evidence from human functional magnetic resonance imaging and non-human primate mean-field spike rate data that functional connectivity and noise correlations reveal similar statistical patterns during task states. In short, we found that task states primarily quench neural variability and correlations in both data sets. To provide a theoretically rigorous account capable of explaining this phenomena across both data sets, we use mean-field dynamical systems modeling to demonstrate the deterministic relationship between task-evoked activity, neural variability and correlations. Together, we provide an integrative account, showing that task-evoked activity quenches neural variability and correlations in large-scale neural systems."}}

It may be possible to utilize the insights gained from experimental control of task processes as reference points for investigating unconstrained rest. To facilitate comparison of rest and task functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we focused on activation amplitude patterns, commonly used for task but not rest analyses. During rest, we identified spontaneous changes in temporally extended whole-brain activation-pattern states. This revealed a hierarchical organization of rest states. The top consisted of two competing states consistent with previously identified \u201ctask-positive\u201d and \u201ctask-negative\u201d activation patterns. These states were composed of more specific states that repeated over time and across individuals. Contrasting with the view that rest consists of only task-negative states, task-positive states occurred 40% of the time while individuals \u201crested,\u201d suggesting task-focused activity may occur during rest. Together our results suggest that brain activation dynamics form a general hierarchy across task and rest, with a small number of dominant general states reflecting basic functional modes and a variety of specific states potentially reflecting a wide variety of cognitive processes."}}

Global connectivity is a broad measure that summarizes both within-network connectivity and across-network connectivity. We used additional graph theoretical measures to better characterize the nature of LPFC connectivity and its relationship with fluid intelligence. We specifically hypothesized that LPFC is a connector hub with an across-network connectivity that contributes to fluid intelligence independent of within-network connectivity. We verified that LPFC was in the top 10% of brain regions in terms of across-network connectivity, suggesting it is a strong connector hub. Importantly, we found that the LPFC across-network connectivity predicted individuals' fluid intelligence and this correlation remained statistically significant when controlling for global connectivity (which includes within-network connectivity). This supports the conclusion that across-network connectivity independently contributes to the relationship between LPFC connectivity and intelligence. These results suggest that LPFC contributes to fluid intelligence by being a connector hub with a truly global multisystem connectivity throughout the brain."}}
