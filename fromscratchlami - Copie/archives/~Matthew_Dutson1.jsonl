The current neural network paradigm of frame-based, floating-point inference is often ill-suited to these resource-constrained applications. Spike-based perception \u2013 enabled by spiking neural networks (SNNs) \u2013 is one promising alternative. Unlike conventional neural networks (ANNs), spiking networks exhibit smooth tradeoffs between latency, power, and accuracy. SNNs are the archetype of an \"anytime algorithm\" whose accuracy improves smoothly over time. This property allows SNNs to adapt their computational investment in response to changing resource constraints. Unfortunately, mainstream algorithms for training SNNs (i.e., those based on ANN-to-SNN conversion) tend to produce models that are inefficient in practice. To mitigate this problem, we propose a set of principled optimizations that reduce latency and power consumption by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude in converted SNNs. These optimizations leverage a set of novel efficiency metrics designed for anytime algorithms. We also develop a state-of-the-art simulator, SaRNN, which can simulate SNNs using commodity GPU hardware and neuromorphic platforms. We hope that the proposed optimizations, metrics, and tools will facilitate the future development of spike-based vision systems."}}

Unfortunately, their accuracy frequently comes with high computational costs. This is a particular issue in video recognition, where models are often applied repeatedly across frames or temporal chunks. In this work, we exploit temporal redundancy between subsequent inputs to reduce the cost of Transformers for video processing. We describe a method for identifying and re-processing only those tokens that have changed significantly over time. Our proposed family of models, Eventful Transformers, can be converted from existing Transformers (often without any re-training) and give adaptive control over the compute cost at runtime. We evaluate our method on large-scale datasets for video object detection (ImageNet VID) and action recognition (EPIC-Kitchens 100). Our approach leads to significant computational savings (on the order of 2-4x) with only minor reductions in accuracy."}}

Such redundancy occurs at multiple levels of complexity, from low-level pixel values to textures and high-level semantics. We propose Event Neural Networks (EvNets), which leverage this redundancy to achieve considerable computation savings during video inference. A defining characteristic of EvNets is that each neuron has state variables that provide it with long-term memory, which allows low-cost, high-accuracy inference even in the presence of significant camera motion. We show that it is possible to transform a wide range of neural networks into EvNets without re-training. We demonstrate our method on state-of-the-art architectures for both high- and low-level visual processing, including pose recognition, object detection, optical flow, and image enhancement. We observe roughly an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational costs compared to conventional networks, with minimal reductions in model accuracy."}}
