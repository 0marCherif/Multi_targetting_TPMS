Shapley interaction indices extend the SV to define any-order feature interaction scores. Defining a unique Shapley interaction index is an open research question and, so far, three definitions have been proposed, which differ by their choice of axioms. Moreover, each definition requires a specific approximation technique. Here, we propose SHAPley Interaction Quantification (SHAP-IQ), an efficient sampling-based approximator to compute Shapley interactions for arbitrary cardinal interaction indices (CII), i.e. interaction indices that satisfy the linearity, symmetry and dummy axiom. SHAP-IQ is based on a novel representation and, in contrast to existing methods, we provide theoretical guarantees for its approximation quality, as well as estimates for the variance of the point estimates. For the special case of SV, our approach reveals a novel representation of the SV and corresponds to Unbiased KernelSHAP with a greatly simplified calculation. We illustrate the computational efficiency and effectiveness by explaining language, image classification and high-dimensional synthetic models."}}

However, machine learning is often applied in dynamic environments, where data arrives continuously and learning must be done in an online manner. Therefore, we propose iSAGE, a time- and memory-efficient incrementalization of SAGE, which is able to react to changes in the model as well as to drift in the data-generating process. We further provide efficient feature removal methods that break (interventional) and retain (observational) feature dependencies. Moreover, we formally analyze our explanation method to show that iSAGE adheres to similar theoretical properties as SAGE. Finally, we evaluate our approach in a thorough experimental analysis based on well-established data sets and data streams with concept drift."}}

We are interested in dynamic scenarios where data is sampled progressively, and learning is done in an incremental rather than a batch mode. We seek efficient incremental algorithms for computing feature importance (FI) measures, specifically, an incremental FI measure based on feature marginalization of absent features similar to permutation feature importance (PFI). We propose an efficient, model-agnostic algorithm called iPFI to estimate this measure incrementally and under dynamic modeling conditions including concept drift. We prove theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality in terms of expectation and variance. To validate our theoretical findings and the efficacy of our approaches compared to traditional batch PFI, we conduct multiple experimental studies on benchmark data with and without concept drift."}}

In this paper, we consider XAI in the context of online learning in dynamic environments, such as learning from real-time data streams, where models are learned incrementally and continuously adapted over the course of time. More specifically, we motivate the problem of explaining model change, i.e. explaining the difference between models before and after adaptation, instead of the models themselves. In this regard, we provide the first efficient model-agnostic approach to dynamically detecting, quantifying, and explaining significant model changes. Our approach is based on an adaptation of the well-known Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) measure. It includes two hyperparameters that control the sensitivity and directly influence explanation frequency, so that a human user can adjust the method to individual requirements and application needs. We assess and validate our method\u2019s efficacy on illustrative synthetic data streams with three popular model classes."}}
