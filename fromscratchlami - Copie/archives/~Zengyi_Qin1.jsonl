We develop a model-based learning approach to synthesize robust feedback controllers with safety and stability guarantees. We take inspiration from robust convex optimization and Lyapunov theory to define robust control Lyapunov barrier functions that generalize despite model uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach in simulation on problems including car trajectory tracking, nonlinear control with obstacle avoidance, satellite rendezvous with safety constraints, and flight control with a learned ground effect model. Simulation results show that our approach yields controllers that match or exceed the capabilities of robust MPC while reducing computational costs by an order of magnitude.

Our core idea is to learn the multi-agent control policy jointly with  learning the control barrier functions as safety certificates. We propose a new joint-learning framework that can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, which can adapt to an arbitrarily large number of agents. Building upon this framework, we further improve the scalability by  incorporating neural network architectures  that are invariant to the quantity and permutation of neighboring agents. In addition, we propose a new spontaneous policy refinement method to further enforce the certificate condition during testing. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other leading multi-agent control approaches in terms of maintaining safety and completing original tasks. Our approach also shows substantial generalization capability in that the control policy can be trained with 8 agents in one scenario, while being used on other scenarios with up to 1024 agents in complex multi-agent environments and dynamics.

However, existing methods typically rely on tuning reward or cost parameters to encode the constraints, which can be tedious and tend to not generalize well. Instead of building sophisticated cost functions for constraints, we present a pioneering study of imposing constraints directly on the state density function of the system. Density functions have clear physical meanings and can express a variety of constraints in a straightforward fashion. We prove the duality between the density function and Q function in CRL and use it to develop an effective primal-dual algorithm to solve density constrained reinforcement learning problems. We provide theoretical guarantees of the optimality of our approach and use a comprehensive set of case studies including standard benchmarks to show that our method outperforms other leading CRL methods in terms of achieving higher reward while respecting the constraints."}}

Different from previous methods using pixel-level depth maps, we propose to employ 3D anchors to explicitly construct object-level correspondences between the regions of interest in stereo images, from which the deep neural network learns to detect and triangulate the targeted object in 3D space. We also introduce a cost-efficient channel reweighting strategy that enhances representational features and weakens noisy signals to facilitate the learning process. All of these are flexibly integrated into a solid baseline detector that inputs monocular images. We demonstrate that both the monocular baseline and the stereo triangulation learning network outperform the prior state-of-the-arts in 3D object detection and localization on the challenging KITTI dataset."}}

We propose MonoGRNet for the amodal 3D object localization from a monocular RGB image via geometric reasoning in both the observed 2D projection and the unobserved depth dimension. MonoGRNet is a single, unified network composed of four task-specific subnetworks, responsible for 2D object detection, instance depth estimation (IDE), 3D localization and local corner regression. Unlike the pixel-level depth estimation that needs per-pixel annotations, we propose a novel IDE method that directly predicts the depth of the targeting 3D bounding box\u2019s center using sparse supervision. The 3D localization is further achieved by estimating the position in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Finally, MonoGRNet is jointly learned by optimizing the locations and poses of the 3D bounding boxes in the global context. We demonstrate that MonoGRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets."}}
