However, the scope of weak supervision supported by these approaches has been very restrictive, preventing them to use all available information. In this work, we propose ProbKT, a framework based on probabilistic logical reasoning that allows to train object detection models with arbitrary types of weak supervision. We empirically show on different datasets that using all available information is beneficial as our ProbKT leads to significant improvement on target domain and better generalization compared to existing baselines. We also showcase the ability of our approach to handle complex logic statements as supervision signal."}}

The MELLODDY platform was the first industry-scale platform to enable the creation of a global federated model for drug discovery without sharing the confidential data sets of the individual partners. The federated model was trained on the platform by aggregating the gradients of all contributing partners in a cryptographic, secure way following each training iteration. The platform was deployed on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) multi-account architecture running Kubernetes clusters in private subnets. Organisationally, the roles of the different partners were codified as different rights and permissions on the platform and administrated in a decentralized way. The MELLODDY platform generated new scientific discoveries which are described in a companion paper."}}

On the other hand, there are non-negligible risks stemming from the unintended leakage of participants' training data, hence, it is essential for such a platform to be secure and privacy-preserving. This paper describes a privacy risk assessment for collaborative modeling in the preclinical phase of drug discovery to accelerate the selection of promising drug candidates. After a short taxonomy of state-of-the-art inference attacks we adopt and customize several to the underlying scenario. Finally we describe and experiments with a handful of relevant privacy protection techniques to mitigate such attacks."}}

To address these challenges, we propose (1) a continuous-time version of the Gated Recurrent Unit, building upon the recent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Chen et al., 2018), and (2) a Bayesian update network that processes the sporadic observations. We bring these two ideas together in our GRU-ODE-Bayes method. We then demonstrate that the proposed method encodes a continuity prior for the latent process and that it can exactly represent the Fokker-Planck dynamics of complex processes driven by a multidimensional stochastic differential equation. Additionally, empirical evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state of the art on both synthetic data and real-world data with applications in healthcare and climate forecast. What is more, the continuity prior is shown to be well suited for low number of samples settings.\n"}}

We are interested to learn $$f: U \\rightarrow W$$ where we have a fully mediating representation V such that f factors into $$U \\rightarrow V \\rightarrow W$$ . However, observing V requires detailed and expensive labels. We propose graph aligning approach that generates rich or detailed labels given normal labels W. In this paper we investigate the scenario of domain adaptation from the source domain where we have access to the expensive labels V to the target domain where only normal labels W are available. Focusing on the problem of predicting chemical compound graphs from 2D images the fully mediating layer is represented using the planar embedding of the chemical graph structure we are predicting. The empirical results show that, using only 4000 data points, we obtain up\u00a0to 4x improvement of performance after domain adaptation to target domain compared to pretrained model only on the source domain. After domain adaptation, the model is even able to detect atom types that were never observed in the original source domain. Finally, on the Maybridge data set the proposed self-labeling approach reached higher performance than the current state of the art."}}

Several architectures have been recently proposed for deep learning from molecular graphs, but they suffer from information bottlenecks because they only pass information from a graph node to its direct neighbors. Here, we introduce a more expressive route-based multi-attention mechanism that incorporates features from routes between node pairs. We call the resulting method Graph Informer. A single network layer can therefore attend to nodes several steps away. We show empirically that the proposed method compares favorably against existing approaches in two prediction tasks: (1)\u00a013C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra, improving the state-of-the-art with an MAE of 1.35 ppm and (2)\u00a0predicting drug bioactivity and toxicity. Additionally, we develop a variant called injective Graph Informer that is provably more powerful than the Weisfeiler-Lehman test for graph isomorphism. We demonstrate that the route information allows the method to be informed about the non-local topology of the graph and, thus, it goes beyond the capabilities of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test.
