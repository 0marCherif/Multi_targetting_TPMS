We evaluate our approach in the context of an educational domain involving 14,043 question-solving interactions from 1,260 students. We argue that including time-based attention can be beneficial for event sequence modeling applications where the inter-event time intervals and the interpretation of the model's prediction both are crucial."}}

These systems capture a rich array of data as students interact with them. Predicting student performance is an essential part of technology-enhanced education systems to enable the generation of hints and provide recommendations to students. Typically, this is done through use of data on student interactions with questions without utilizing important data on the temporal ordering of students\u2019 other interaction behavior, (e.g., reading, video watching). In this paper, we hypothesize that to predict students\u2019 question performance, it is necessary to (i) consider other learning activities beyond question-answering and (ii) understand how these activities are related to question-solving behavior. We collected middle school physical science students\u2019 data within a K12 reading platform, Actively Learn. This platform provides reading-support to students and collects trace data on their use of the system. We propose a transformer-based model to predict students' question scores utilizing question interaction and reading-related behaviors. Our findings show that integrating question attempts and reading-related behaviors results in better predictive power compared to using only question attempt features. The interpretable visualization of the transformer\u2019s attention can be helpful for teachers to make tailored interventions in students\u2019 learning."}}

A taxonomy of IaC defects can be useful for understanding the nature of defects, and identifying activities needed to fix and prevent defects in IaC scripts. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by developing a defect taxonomy for IaC scripts through qualitative analysis. We develop a taxonomy of IaC defects by applying qualitative analysis on 1,448 defect-related commits collected from open source software (OSS) repositories of the Openstack organization. We conduct a survey with 66 practitioners to assess if they agree with the identified defect categories included in our taxonomy. We quantify the frequency of identified defect categories by analyzing 80,425 commits collected from 291 OSS repositories spanning across 2005 to 2019. Our defect taxonomy for IaC consists of eight categories, including a category specific to IaC called idempotency (i.e., defects that lead to incorrect system provisioning when the same IaC script is executed multiple times). We observe the surveyed 66 practitioners to agree most with idempotency. The most frequent defect category is configuration data i.e., providing erroneous configuration data in IaC scripts. Our taxonomy and the quantified frequency of the defect categories may help in advancing the science of IaC script quality."}}

Bugs in COVID-19 software can be consequential, as COVID-19 software projects can impact public health policy and user data privacy. Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners and researchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study of open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129 open source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our empirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from the collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug categories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and storage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories of software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to perform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software that are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model construction through better synergies between data science practitioners and public health experts. Existence of security bugs in user tracking software necessitates development of tools that will detect data privacy violations and security weaknesses."}}

Our goal in this paper is to identify students' reading behaviors as they engage with instructional texts in domain-specific activities. In this work, we apply theory and methodology from the learning sciences to a large-scale middle school dataset within a digital literacy platform, Actively Learn. We compare students' reading behaviors both within and across domains for 12,566 science and 16,240 social studies students. Our findings show that higher-performing students in science engaged in more metacognitively-rich reading activities, such as text annotation; whereas lower-performing students relied more on simple highlighting and took longer to respond to embedded questions. Higher-performing students in social studies, by contrast, engaged more with the vocabulary and took longer to read before attempting question responses. Our finding may be used as recommendations to help both teachers and students engage in and support more effective behaviors."}}

Developers use programming languages such as Julia to build scientific software. When programming with Julia, developers experience program execution time discrepancy i.e. not obtaining desired program execution time, which hinders them to efficiently complete their tasks. The goal of this paper is to help developers in achieving desired program execution time for Julia by identifying the causes of why program execution time discrepancies happen with an empirical study of Stack Overflow posts. We conduct an empirical study with 263 Julia-related posts collected from Stack Overflow, and apply qualitative analysis on the collected 263 posts. We identify 9 categories of program execution time discrepancies for Julia, which include discrepancies related to data structures usage such as, arrays and dictionaries. We also identify 10 causes that explain why the program execution time discrepancies happen. For example, we identify program execution time discrepancy to happen when developers unnecessarily allocate memory by using array comprehension."}}
