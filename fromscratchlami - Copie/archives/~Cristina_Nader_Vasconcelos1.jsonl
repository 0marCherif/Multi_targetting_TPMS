While the systems\u2019 visual resources are accurate and immersive, precise interfaces require depth cameras or special joysticks, requiring either complex devices or not following the natural body expression. This work presents an approach for the usage of bare hands to control an immersive game from an egocentric perspective and built from a proposed case study methodology. We used a DenseNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform the recognition in real-time, from both indoor and outdoor environments, not requiring any image segmentation process. Our research also generated a vocabulary, considering users\u2019 preferences, seeking a set of natural and comfortable hand poses and evaluated users\u2019 satisfaction and performance for an entertainment setup. Our recognition model achieved an accuracy of 97.89%. The user\u2019s studies show that our method outperforms the classical controllers in regards to natural interactions. We demonstrate our results using commercial low-end HMD\u2019s and compare our solution with state-of-the-art methods."}}

The aim of this paper is to efficiently execute the auction algorithm on these architectures. To achieve that, a vectorized version was implemented and evaluated. These versions were then run in parallel using the OpenMP library. Finally, to optimize the number of threads used during the execution, a malleable strategy is proposed and evaluated. Results show that the vectorized version outperforms the sequential one by a factor of 10, while the malleable vectorized version was able to adapt its execution to exploit the full potential of multicore architectures."}}

Abstract The recent developments in virtual and mixed reality by the video game and entertainment industries are responsible for increasing user\u2019s visual immersion and provide a better user experience in games and other interactive simulations. However, the interaction between the user and simulated environment still relies on game controllers or other unnatural handheld devices. In the mixed reality context, the usage of more natural and immersive alternative to the game controllers, such as the user\u2019s hands, may drastically increase the game interface experience, allowing a personalized visual feedback of the user\u2019s interactions in the real-time simulation. There are basically two approaches for including the user\u2019s hand: a 3D reconstruction based method, typically based on depth cameras, or an image-based approach, composing the virtual scene with the real images of the user\u2019s hands. In the composition of the user\u2019s hands and virtual elements, perceptual discrepancies in the illumination of objects may occur, generating an inconsistency in the illumination of the mixed reality environment. A consistent illumination of the environment greatly improves the user\u2019s immersion in the mixed reality application. One way to ensure consistent illumination is by estimating the real-world illumination and use this information to adapt the virtual world lighting setting. We present the Spherical Harmonics Light Probe Estimator, a deep learning based technique that estimates the lighting setting of the real-world environment. The method uses a single RGB image and does not requires prior knowledge of the scene. The estimator outputs a light probe of the real-world lighting, represented by 9 spherical harmonics coefficients. The estimated light probe is used to create a composite image containing both real and virtual elements in an environment with a consistent illumination. We validate the technique through synthetic tests achieving an RMS error of 0.0573. We show the usage of the method in an augmented virtuality application.

In that direction, human motion is being captured by different sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, heat sensors and cameras. However, there is still room for investigation the analysis of motion data captured from low-cost sensors. This article explores the extent to which a full body motion classification can be achieved by observing only sparse data captured by two separate inherent wereable measurement unit (IMU) sensors. For that, we developed a novel Recurrent Neural Network topology based on Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) that are able to classify motions sequences of different sizes. Using cross-validation tests, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96% which is quite significant considering that the raw data used was obtained using only 2 simple and accessible IMU sensors capturing arms movements. We also built and made public a motion database constructed by capturing sparse data from 11 actors performing five different actions. For comparison with existent methods, other deep learning approaches for sequence evaluation (more specifically, based on convolutional neural networks), were adapted to our problem and evaluated."}}

While these systems provide highly immersive experiences, many users have been reporting discomfort symptoms, such as nausea, sickness, and headaches, among others. When using VR for health applications, this is more critical, since the discomfort may interfere a lot in treatments. In this work we discuss possible causes of these issues, and present possible solutions as design guidelines that may mitigate them. In this context, we go deeper within a dynamic focus solution to reduce discomfort in immersive virtual environments, when using first-person navigation. This solution applies an heuristic model of visual attention that works in real time. This work also discusses a case study (as a first-person spatial shooter demo) that applies this solution and the proposed design guidelines."}}

To solve that matching problem the auction algorithm has been widely used and its parallel implementation is employed to find matching solutions in a reasonable computational time. For example, image analysis may require a large amount of processing, as dense images can have thousands of points to be considered. Furthermore, to exploit the benefits of multicore architectures, a hybrid implementation can be used to deal with communication in both distributed and shared memory. The main goal of this paper is to implement and evaluate the performance of an hybrid parallel auction algorithm for multicore clusters. The experiments carried out analyzes the problem size, the number of iterations to solve the matching and the impact of these parameters in the communication costs and how it affects the execution times."}}

However, such images were obtained from open scenarios with fixed imaging geometry parameters, which may produce a network not suitable for detecting a person in more general settings, such as the ones found in surveillance systems. As gathering and annotating data is a highly expensive manual task, we propose a methodology for artificially augmenting the positive training set with automatically generated local image affine and perspective transforms. Furthermore, to enrich the variability of background images, we include to the negative training set images that resemble human figures automatically obtained by the proposed methodology over images from commonly found surveillance scenarios. Extensive results show that by providing the enriched data as the input to a Convolutional Neural Network it is possible to precisely detect pedestrians in a number of public datasets. The data enrichment proposed here may also be used in other detectors based on supervised learning architectures, as the process is independent from the learning algorithm employed."}}
