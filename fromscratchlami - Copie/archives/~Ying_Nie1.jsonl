Compared with convolutional neural networks limited by the relatively small receptive fields, the advantage of transformer for visual tasks is the capacity to perceive long-range dependencies among all image patches, while the deficiency is that the local fine-grained information is not fully excavated. In this paper, we introduce the Coarse-grained and Fine-grained crossing representations to build an efficient Detection Transformer (CFDT). Specifically, we propose a local-global cross fusion module to establish the connection between local fine-grained features and global coarse-grained features. Besides, we propose a coarse-fine aware neck which enables detection tokens to interact with both coarse-grained and fine-grained features. Furthermore, an efficient feature integration module is presented for fusing multi-scale representations from different stages. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For instance, our CFDT achieves 48.1 AP with 173G FLOPs, which possesses higher accuracy and less computation compared with the state-of-the-art transformer-based detector ViDT.

To achieve higher hardware efficiency, it is necessary to further study the low-bit quantization of AdderNet. Due to the limitation that the commutative law in multiplication does not hold in L1-norm, the well-established quantization methods on convolutional networks cannot be applied on AdderNets. Thus, the existing AdderNet quantization techniques propose to use only one shared scale to quantize both the weights and activations simultaneously. Admittedly, such an approach can keep the commutative law in the  L1-norm quantization process, while the accuracy drop after low-bit quantization cannot be ignored. To this end, we first thoroughly analyze the difference on distributions of weights and activations in AdderNet and then propose a new quantization algorithm by redistributing the weights and the activations. Specifically, the pre-trained full-precision weights in different kernels are clustered into different groups, then the intra-group sharing and inter-group independent scales can be adopted. To further compensate the accuracy drop caused by the distribution difference, we then develop a lossless range clamp scheme for weights and a simple yet effective outliers clamp strategy for activations. Thus, the functionality of full-precision weights and the representation ability of full-precision activations can be fully preserved. The effectiveness of the proposed quantization method for AdderNet is well verified on several benchmarks, e.g., our 4-bit post-training quantized adder ResNet-18 achieves an 66.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet with comparable energy efficiency,  which is about 8.5% higher than that of the previous AdderNet quantization methods.

The problem on feature redundancy is well studied in visual recognition task, but rarely discussed in SISR. Based on the observation that many features in SISR models are also similar to each other, we propose to use shift operation to generate the redundant features (i.e., ghost features). Compared with depth-wise convolution which is time-consuming on GPU-like devices, shift operation can bring a practical inference acceleration for CNNs on common hardwares. We analyze the benefits of shift operation on SISR task and make the shift orientation learnable based on Gumbel-Softmax trick. Besides, a clustering procedure is explored based on pre-trained models to identify the intrinsic filters for generating intrinsic features. The ghost features will be derived by moving these intrinsic features along a specific orientation. Finally, the complete output features are constructed by concatenating the intrinsic and ghost features together. Extensive experiments on several benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that both the non-compact and lightweight SISR models embedded with the proposed method can achieve a comparable performance to that of their baselines with a large reduction of parameters, FLOPs and GPU inference latency. For instance, we reduce the parameters by 46%, FLOPs by 46% and GPU inference latency by 42% of $\\times2$ EDSR network with basically lossless performance."}}
