These ad-hoc transformation problems are typically solved by one-off scripts, which is both difficult and time-consuming.\n\nOur observation is that these domain-specific transformation problems have long been solved by developers with code libraries, which are often shared in places like GitHub. We thus develop an extensible data transformation system called Transform-Data-by-Example (TDE) that can leverage rich transformation logic in source code, DLLs, web services and mapping tables, so that end-users only need to provide a few (typically 3) input/output examples, and TDE can synthesize desired programs using relevant transformation logic from these sources. The beta version of TDE was released in Office Store for Excel."}}

Most existing label models require a parameter learning step for each dataset. In this work, we present a hyper label model that (once learned) infers the ground-truth labels for each dataset in a single forward pass without dataset-specific parameter learning. The hyper label model approximates an optimal analytical (yet computationally intractable) solution of the ground-truth labels. We train the model on synthetic data generated in the way that ensures the model approximates the analytical optimal solution, and build the model upon Graph Neural Network (GNN) to ensure the model prediction being invariant (or equivariant) to the permutation of LFs (or data points). On 14 real-world datasets, our hyper label model outperforms the best existing methods in both accuracy (by 1.4 points on average) and efficiency (by six times on average).
