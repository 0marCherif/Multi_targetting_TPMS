Under the constant positive linear dependence condition on manifolds, we show that the proposed method converges to a stationary point of the nonsmooth manifold optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a globalized semismooth Newton method to solve the augmented Lagrangian subproblem on manifolds efficiently. The local superlinear convergence of the manifold semismooth Newton method is also established under some suitable conditions. We also prove that the semismoothness on submanifolds can be inherited from that in the ambient manifold. Finally, numerical experiments on compressed modes and (constrained) sparse principal component analysis illustrate the advantages of the proposed method."}}

To address this issue, a recent line of work has investigated the possibility of directly conducting approximate inference in \"function space\", the space of prediction functions. This note provides an alternative perspective to this problem, by showing that for many models -- including a simplified neural network model -- Langevin dynamics in the overparameterized \"weight space\" induces equivalent function-space trajectories to certain Langevin dynamics procedures in function space. Thus, the former can already be viewed as a function-space inference algorithm, with its convergence unaffected by overparameterization. We provide simulations on Bayesian neural network models, and discuss the implication of the results. "}}

An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than  DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.\n"}}

Despite their high-quality generation performance, DPMs still suffer from their slow sampling as they generally need hundreds or thousands of sequential function evaluations (steps) of large neural networks to draw a sample. Sampling from DPMs can be viewed alternatively as solving the corresponding diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this work, we propose an exact formulation of the solution of diffusion ODEs. The formulation analytically computes the linear part of the solution, rather than leaving all terms to black-box ODE solvers as adopted in previous works. By applying change-of-variable, the solution can be equivalently simplified to an exponentially weighted integral of the neural network. Based on our formulation, we propose DPM-Solver, a fast dedicated high-order solver for diffusion ODEs with the convergence order guarantee. DPM-Solver is suitable for both discrete-time and continuous-time DPMs without any further training.
