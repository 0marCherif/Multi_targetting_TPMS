Such samples may arise in the form of replicated networks\ndrawn from a common distribution, or in the form of heterogeneous networks, with the network\ngenerating process varying from one network to another, e.g. dynamic and cross-sectional\nnetworks. Nonparametric methods for undirected networks have focused on estimation of\nthe graphon model. While the graphon model accounts for nodal heterogeneity, it does not\naccount for network heterogeneity, a feature specific to applications where multiple networks\nare observed. To address this setting of multiple networks, we propose a multi-graphon model\nwhich allows node-level as well as network-level heterogeneity. We show how information from\nmultiple networks can be leveraged to enable estimation of the multi-graphon via standard\nnonparametric regression techniques, e.g. kernel regression, orthogonal series estimation. We\nstudy theoretical properties of the proposed estimator establishing recovery of the latent nodal\npositions up to negligible error, and convergence of the multi-graphon estimator to the normal\ndistribution. Finite sample performance are investigated in a simulation study and application\nto two real-world networks\u2014a dynamic contact network of ants and a collection of structural\nbrain networks from different subjects\u2014illustrate the utility of our approach."}}

These methods work well for separating mixtures recorded in low-to-medium level of reverberation, however, their performance degrades as the level of reverberation is increased. We note that the relatively poor performance of these methods under reverberant conditions can be attributed to the high variance of the frequency-dependent GMM parameter estimates. To address this limitation, a novel bootstrap-based approach is proposed to improve the accuracy of expectation maximization estimates of a frequency-dependent GMM based on an a priori chosen initialization scheme. It is shown how the proposed technique allows us to construct time-frequency masks which lead to improved model-based source separation for reverberant speech mixtures. Experiments and analysis are performed on speech mixtures formed using real room-recorded impulse responses."}}

If the hypothesis is rejected, frequency bands causing the rejection will be identified and might usefully be related to known properties of the physical processes. The test needs the associated spectral matrix that can be estimated by multitaper methods by using, say, K tapers. Standard asymptotic distributions for the test statistic are of no use since they would require K \u2192 \u221e, but, as K increases so does resolution bandwidth that causes spectral blurring. In many analyses, K is necessarily kept small, and hence our efforts are directed at practical and accurate methodology for hypothesis testing for small K. Our generalized likelihood ratio statistic combined with exact cumulant matching gives very accurate rejection percentages. We also prove that the statistic on which the test is based is comprised of canonical coherencies arising from our complex-valued vector time series. Frequency specific tests are combined by using multiple hypothesis testing to give an overall test. Our methodology is demonstrated on ocean current data collected at different depths in the Labrador Sea. Overall, this paper extends results on propriety testing for complex-valued vectors to the complex-valued vector time series setting."}}

Here, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to compute maximum-likelihood estimates of the unknown model parameters. A by-product of the EM algorithm is a time-frequency (T-F) mask which allows the estimation of the target source from the given mixture. In this paper, we propose the idea of bootstrap averaging to improve separation quality from mixtures recorded under reverberant conditions. Our experiments on real speech mixture signals show an increase in the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) over a state-of-the-art baseline algorithm, to our knowledge, currently, the best performing technique in this class of methods."}}

Wind speed and direction are modelled as the magnitude and phase of complex time series and measurements from multiple geographic locations are embedded in a complex vector which is then used as input to a multichannel Wiener prediction filter. Building on a C-linear cyclo-stationary predictor, a new widely linear filter is developed and tested on hourly mean wind speed and direction measurements made at 13 locations in the UK over 6 years. The new predictor shows a reduction in mean squared error at all locations. Furthermore it is found that the scale of that reduction strongly depends on conditions local to the measurement site."}}

We show that it is possible to make inference such as confidence intervals on these parameters using a vector-valued circulant embedding simulation method, combined with bootstrapping. We apply the methodology to three parameters of interest in oceanography, and compare the resulting simulated confidence intervals with those computed using analytic results. We conclude that the simulation scheme offers an inference approach either in the absence of theoretical distributional results, or to check the effect of nuisance parameters where theoretical results are available."}}
