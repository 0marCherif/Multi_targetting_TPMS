We introduce a companion benchmark,TAP-Vid, which is composed of both real-world videos with accurate human annotations of point tracks, and synthetic videos with perfect ground-truth point tracks.

To this end, we introduce a new object-centric video recognition model based on a transformer architecture. The model learns a set of object-centric summary vectors for the video, and uses these vectors to fuse the visual and spatio-temporal trajectory 'modalities' of the video clip. We also introduce a novel trajectory contrast loss to further enhance objectness in these summary vectors. With experiments on four datasets -- SomethingSomething-V2, SomethingElse, Action Genome and EpicKitchens -- we show that the object-centric model outperforms prior video representations (both object-agnostic and object-aware), when: (1) classifying actions on unseen objects and unseen environments; (2) low-shot learning of novel classes; (3) linear probe to other downstream tasks; as well as (4) for standard action classification."}}

We cast this into a query-response mechanism, where each query addresses a particular question, and has its own response label set. We make the following four contributions: (I) We propose a new model - a Temporal Query Network - which enables the query-response functionality, and a structural understanding of fine-grained actions. It attends to relevant segments for each query with a temporal attention mechanism, and can be trained using only the labels for each query. (ii) We propose a new way - stochastic feature bank update - to train a network on videos of various lengths with the dense sampling required to respond to fine-grained queries. (iii) We compare the TQN to other architectures and text supervision methods, and analyze their pros and cons. Finally, (iv) we evaluate the method extensively on the FineGym and Diving48 benchmarks for fine-grained action classification and surpass the state-of-the-art using only RGB features."}}

In this work, we illustrate how the neural network representations which underpin modern vision systems are subject to supervision collapse, whereby they lose any information that is not necessary for performing the training task, including information that may be necessary for transfer to new tasks or domains. We then propose two methods to mitigate this problem. First, we employ self-supervised learning to encourage general-purpose features that transfer better. Second, we propose a novel Transformer based neural network architecture called CrossTransformers, which can take a small number of labeled images and an unlabeled query, find coarse spatial correspondence between the query and the labeled images, and then infer class membership by computing distances between spatially-corresponding features. The result is a classifier that is more robust to task and domain shift, which we demonstrate via state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset, a recent dataset for evaluating transfer from ImageNet to many other vision datasets."}}

We formulate the text recogni- tion task as one of aligning the conditional distribution of strings predicted from given text images, with lexically valid strings sam- pled from target corpora. This enables fully automated, and unsu- pervised learning from just line-level text-images, and unpaired text-string samples, obviating the need for large aligned datasets. We present detailed analysis for various aspects of the proposed method, namely - (1) the impact of the length of training sequences on convergence, (2) relation between character frequencies and the order in which they are learnt, and (3) demonstrate the generalization ability of our recognition network to inputs of arbitrary lengths. Finally, we demonstrate excellent text recognition accuracy on both synthetically generated text images, and scanned images of real printed books, using no labelled training examples."}}

This allows us to learn a detector from a large collection of raw videos given only a few example annotations harvested from existing data or motion capture. We achieve this by formulating the landmark detection task as one of image translation, learning to map an image of the object to an image of its landmarks, represented as a skeleton. The advantage is that this translation problem can then be tackled by CycleGAN. However, we show that a naive application of CycleGAN confounds appearance and pose information, with suboptimal keypoint detection performance. We solve this problem by introducing an analytical and differentiable renderer for the skeleton image so that no appearance in- formation can be leaked in the skeleton. Then, since cycle consistency requires to reconstruct the input image from the skeleton, we supply the appearance information thus removed by conditioning the generator with a second image of the same object (e.g. another frame from a video). Furthermore, while CycleGAN uses two cycle consistency constraints, we show that the second one is detrimental in this application and we discard it, significantly simplifying the model. We show that these modifications improve the quality of the learned detector leading to state-of-the-art unsupervised landmark detection performance in a num- ber of challenging human pose and facial landmark detec- tion benchmarks."}}

In this work we aim to learn object representations that are useful for control and reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce Transporter, a neural network architecture for discovering concise geometric object representations in terms of keypoints or image-space coordinates. Our method learns from raw video frames in a fully unsupervised manner, by transporting learnt image features between video frames using a keypoint bottleneck. The discovered keypoints track objects and object parts across long time-horizons more accurately than recent similar methods. Furthermore, consistent long-term tracking enables two notable results in control domains -- (1) using the keypoint co-ordinates and corresponding image features as inputs enables highly sample-efficient reinforcement learning; (2) learning to explore by controlling keypoint locations drastically reduces the search space, enabling deep exploration (leading to states unreachable through random action exploration) without any extrinsic rewards."}}

We cast this as the problem of generating images that combine the appearance of the object as seen in a first example image with the geometry of the object as seen in a second example image, where the two examples differ by a viewpoint change and/or an object deformation. In order to factorize appearance and geometry, we introduce a tight bottleneck in the geometry-extraction process that selects and distils geometry-related features. Compared to standard image generation problems, which often use generative adversarial networks, our generation task is conditioned on both appearance and geometry and thus is significantly less ambiguous, to the point that adopting a simple perceptual loss formulation is sufficient. We demonstrate that our approach can learn object landmarks from synthetic image deformations or videos, all without manual supervision, while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised landmark detectors. We further show that our method is applicable to a large variety of datasets - faces, people, 3D objects, and digits - without any modifications."}}

The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2% on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU."}}
