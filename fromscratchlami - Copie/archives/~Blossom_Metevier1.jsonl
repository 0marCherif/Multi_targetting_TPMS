Existing fairness-aware algorithms consider static fairness constraints, such as equal opportunity or demographic parity, but enforcing constraints of this type may result in models that have a negative long-term impact on disadvantaged individuals and communities. We introduce ELF (Enforcing Long-term Fairness), the first classification algorithm that provides high-confidence fairness guarantees in terms of long-term, or delayed, impact. Importantly, ELF solves the open problem of providing such guarantees based only on historical data that includes observations of delayed impact. Prior methods, by contrast, require prior knowledge (or an estimate) of analytical models describing the relationship between a classifier's predictions and their corresponding delayed impact. We prove that ELF satisfies delayed-impact fairness constraints with high confidence and that it is guaranteed to identify a fair solution, if one exists, given sufficient data. We show empirically, using real-life data, that ELF can successfully mitigate long-term unfairness with high confidence."}}

To address this challenge, recent machine learning algorithms have been designed to limit the likelihood such unfair behaviors will occur. However, these approaches typically assume the data used for training is representative of what will be encountered once the model is deployed, thus limiting their usefulness. In particular, if certain subgroups of the population become more or less probable after the model is deployed (a phenomenon we call demographic shift), the fair-ness assurances provided by prior algorithms are often invalid. We consider the impact of demographic shift and present a class of algorithms, called Shifty algorithms, that provide high-confidence behavioral guarantees that hold under demographic shift. Shifty is the first technique of its kind and demonstrates an effective strategy for designing algorithms to overcome the challenges demographic shift poses. We evaluate Shifty-ttest, an implementation of Shifty based on Student\u2019s \ud835\udc61-test, and, using a real-world data set of university entrance exams and subsequent student success, show that the models output by our algorithm avoid unfair bias under demo-graphic shift, unlike existing methods. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm\u2019s high-confidence fairness guarantees are valid in practice and that our algorithm is an effective tool for training models that are fair when demographic shift occurs."}}

Unlike previous work, our algorithm accepts multiple fairness definitions and allows users to construct their own unique fairness definitions for the problem at hand. We provide a theoretical analysis of RobinHood, which includes a proof that it will not return an unfair solution with probability greater than a user-specified threshold. We validate our algorithm on three applications: a tutoring system in which we conduct a user study and consider multiple unique fairness definitions; a loan approval setting (using the Statlog German credit data set) in which well-known fairness definitions are applied; and criminal recidivism (using data released by Propublica). In each setting our algorithm is able to produce fair policies that achieve performance competitive with other offline and online contextual bandit algorithms."}}
