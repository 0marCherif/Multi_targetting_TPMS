In recent years, various training techniques have been developed, e.g., better divergence measures or stabilization in MCMC sampling, but there often exists a large gap between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs in terms of generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective framework for improving EBMs via contrastive representation learning (CRL). To be specific, we consider representations learned by contrastive methods as the true underlying latent variable. This contrastive latent variable could guide EBMs to understand the data structure better, so it can improve and accelerate EBM training significantly. To enable the joint training of EBM and CRL, we also design a new class of latent-variable EBMs for learning the joint density of data and the contrastive latent variable. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods (e.g., additionally using variational autoencoders or diffusion techniques), even with significantly faster and more memory-efficient training. We also show conditional and compositional generation abilities of our latent-variable EBMs as their additional benefits, even without explicit conditional training.

In practical scenarios where the training data is limited, however, many predictive-yet-compressible signals in the data can be rather from some biases in data acquisition (i.e., less generalizable), so that even the IB objective cannot prevent $\\mathbf{z}$ from co-adapting on such (so-called) \"shortcut\" signals. To bypass such a failure mode, we consider an adversarial threat model of $\\mathbf{x}$ under constraint on the mutual information $I(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{y})$. This motivates us to extend IB to additionally model the nuisance information against $\\mathbf{z}$, namely $\\mathbf{z}_n$, so that $(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{z}_n)$ can reconstruct $\\mathbf{x}$. To enable the idea, we propose an auto-encoder based training upon the variational IB framework, as well as practical encoder designs to facilitate the proposed hybrid discriminative-generative training considering both convolutional- and Transformer-based architectures. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves robustness of learned representations (remarkably without using any domain-specific knowledge), with respect to multiple challenging modern security measures including novelty detection, corruption (or natural) robustness and certified adversarial robustness."}}

Previous TTA schemes assume that the test samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), even though they are often temporally correlated (non-i.i.d.) in application scenarios, e.g., autonomous driving. We discover that most existing TTA methods fail dramatically under such scenarios. Motivated by this, we present a new test-time adaptation scheme that is robust against non-i.i.d. test data streams. Our novelty is mainly two-fold: (a) Instance-Aware Batch Normalization (IABN) that corrects normalization for out-of-distribution samples, and (b) Prediction-balanced Reservoir Sampling (PBRS) that simulates i.i.d. data stream from non-i.i.d. stream in a class-balanced manner. Our evaluation with various datasets, including real-world non-i.i.d. streams, demonstrates that the proposed robust TTA not only outperforms state-of-the-art TTA algorithms in the non-i.i.d. setting, but also achieves comparable performance to those algorithms under the i.i.d. assumption.

Under the smoothed classifiers, the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and (adversarial) robustness has been well evidenced in the literature: i.e., increasing the robustness of a classifier for an input can be at the expense of decreased accuracy for some other inputs. In this paper, we propose a simple training method leveraging this trade-off for obtaining more robust smoothed classifiers, in particular, through a sample-wise control of robustness over the training samples. We enable this control feasible by investigating the correspondence between robustness and prediction confidence of smoothed classifiers: specifically, we propose to use the \"accuracy under Gaussian noise\" as an easy-to-compute proxy of adversarial robustness for each input. We differentiate the training objective depending on this proxy to filter out samples that are unlikely to benefit from the worst-case (adversarial) objective. Our experiments following the standard benchmarks consistently show that the proposed method, despite its simplicity, exhibits improved certified robustness upon existing state-of-the-art training methods."}}

However, the phenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness starts to decrease significantly during AT, has been problematic, not only making practitioners consider a bag of tricks for a successful training, e.g., early stopping, but also incurring a significant generalization gap in the robustness. In this paper, we propose an effective regularization technique that prevents robust overfitting by optimizing an auxiliary 'consistency' regularization loss during AT. Specifically, it forces the predictive distributions after attacking from two different augmentations of the same instance to be similar with each other. Our experimental results demonstrate that such a simple regularization technique brings significant improvements in the test robust accuracy of a wide range of AT methods. More remarkably, we also show that our method could significantly help the model to generalize its robustness against unseen adversaries, e.g., other types or larger perturbations compared to those used during training."}}

It is still unclear, however, that which augmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a wider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way to address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation learning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This \"fusion\" enables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without increasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator overfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the contrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by maintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a strong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are also good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show that GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent techniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly discriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation. Finally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised manner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a simple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD.

In this paper, we introduce OpenCoS, a method for handling this realistic semi-supervised learning scenario based on a recent framework of contrastive learning. One of our key findings is that out-of-class samples in the unlabeled dataset can be identified effectively via (unsupervised) contrastive learning. OpenCoS utilizes this information to overcome the failure modes in the existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, e.g., ReMixMatch or FixMatch. In particular, we propose to assign soft-labels for out-of-class samples using the representation learned from contrastive learning. Our extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of OpenCoS, fixing the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods to be suitable for diverse scenarios involving open-set unlabeled data."}}

This simple approach enables a classifier to learn more generalizable features of minority classes, by transferring and leveraging the diversity of the majority information. Our experimental results on a variety of class-imbalanced datasets show that the proposed method improves the generalization on minority classes significantly compared to other existing re-sampling or re-weighting methods.
