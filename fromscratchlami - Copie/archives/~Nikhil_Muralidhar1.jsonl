The knowledge transfer prowess of ML and especially deep learning (DL) models has been demonstrated to be especially effective under data paucity of the target task. Many scientific phenomena require the execution of costly simulations to estimate the process of interest. Predicting molecular configuration of fluids confined in porous media is one such problem of extreme relevance in many scientific applications, the study of which requires the execution of expensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. However, due to the cost of MD, large scale simulations become intractable. Hence, in this work, we develop a novel science-guided deep learning framework NanoNet-SG to emulate MD simulations. Our proposed NanoNet-SG model leverages scientific domain knowledge in conjunction with knowledge from pre-trained knowledge bases for estimating molecular configuration of fluid mixtures. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that our proposed NanoNet-SG model yields good generalization performance (minimum performance improvement of 16.26 % over baselines) and yields predictions that are consistent with known scientific domain rules despite being trained on a low volume of MD simulation data (i.e., data paucity).

Imaging data of these battery electrodes obtained from X-ray tomography can explain the distribution of material constituents and allow reconstructions to study electron transport pathways. Therefore, it can eventually help quantify various associated properties of electrodes (e.g., volume-specific surface area, porosity) which determine the performance of batteries. However, these images often suffer from low image contrast between multiple material constituents , making it difficult for humans to distinguish and characterize these constituents through visualization. A minor error in detecting distributions among the material constituents can lead to a high error in the calculated parameters of material properties.\nWe present a novel hierarchical curriculum learning framework to address the complex task of estimating material constituent distribution in battery electrodes. To provide spatially smooth prediction, our framework comprises three modules: (i) an uncertainty-aware model trained to yield inferences conditioned upon global knowledge of material distribution, (ii) a technique to capture relatively more fine-grained (local) distributional signals, (iii) an aggregator to appropriately fuse the local and global effects towards obtaining the final distribution.

State forecasting in CPS is imperative for optimal planning of system energy utility and understanding normal operational characteristics of the system thus enabling anomaly detection. Forecasting models can also be used to identify sub-optimal or worn out components and are thereby useful for overall system monitoring. Most existing work only performs single step forecasting but in CPS it is imperative to forecast the next sequence of system states (i.e curve forecasting). In this paper, we propose DyAt (Dynamic Attention) networks, a novel deep learning sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model with a novel hierarchical attention mechanism for long-term time series state forecasting. We evaluate our method on several CPS state forecasting and electric load forecasting tasks and find that our proposed DyAt models yield a performance improvement of at least 13.69% for the CPS state forecasting task and a performance improvement of at least 18.83% for the electric load forecasting task over other state-of-the-art forecasting baselines. We perform rigorous experimentation with several variants of the DyAt model and demonstrate that the DyAt models indeed learn better representations over the entire course of the long term forecast as compared to their counterparts with or without traditional attention mechanisms.

Forecasting the state of CPS, is essential for better planning, resource allocation and minimizing operational costs. It is imperative to forecast the state of a CPS multiple steps into the future to afford enough time for planning of CPS operation to minimize costs and component wear. Forecasting system state also serves as a precursor to detecting process anomalies and faults. Concomitantly, sensors used for data collection are commodity hardware and experience frequent failures resulting in periods with sparse or no data. In such cases, re-construction through imputation of the missing data sequences is imperative to alleviate data sparsity and enable better performance of down-stream analytic models. In this paper, we tackle the problem of CPS state forecasting and data imputation and characterize the performance of a wide array of deep learning architectures - unidirectional gated and non-gated recurrent architectures, sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) architectures as well as bidirectional architectures - with a specific focus towards applications in CPS. We also study the impact of procedures like scheduled sampling and attention, on model training. Our results indicate that Seq2Seq models are superior to traditional step ahead forecasting models and yield an improvement of at least 28.5% for gated recurrent architectures and about 87.6% for non-gated architectures in terms of forecasting performance. We also notice that bidirectional models learn good representations for forecasting as well as for data imputation. Bidirectional Seq2Seq models show an average improvement of 17.6% in forecasting performance over their unidirectional counterparts. We also demonstrate the effect of employing an attention mechanism in the context of Seq2Seq architectures and find that it provides an average improvement of 57.12% in the case of unidirectional Seq2Seq architectures while causing a performance decline in the case of bidirectional Seq2Seq architectures. Finally, we also find that scheduled sampling helps in training better models that yield significantly lower forecasting error."}}

We present an online monitoring system (illiad) that models the state of the CPS as a function of its relationships between constituent components, using a combination of model-based and data-driven strategies. In addition to accurate inference for state estimation and anomaly tracking, illiad also exploits the underlying network structure of the CPS (wired or wireless) for state estimation purposes. We demonstrate the application of illiad to two diverse settings: a wireless sensor motes application and an IEEE 33-bus microgrid."}}

In this paper, we propose domain adapted neural networks (DANN) to explore how domain knowledge can be integrated into model training for deep networks. In particular, we incorporate loss terms for knowledge available as monotonicity constraints and approximation constraints. We evaluate our model on both synthetic data generated using the popular Bohachevsky function and a real-world dataset for predicting oxygen solubility in water.

The speed at which news reaches the reader notwithstanding, the proliferation of blogs and microblogs to deliver specialized content has become the order of the day. Even highly engaged users tend to disengage with a website when the content they are served is unappealing to them. While recommendation systems have been used to ensure delivery of content to the user in tune with their tastes, these systems face an unprecedented challenge - the transient nature of 'popular' news and users' changing interests. Moreover, the challenge is compounded by the absence of explicit feedback. Most recommendation systems for recommending digital news content rely on inferring user engagement through 'clicks', which is not necessarily an accurate measure as it gives us no explicit information about the degree to which a user is interested in a news article. In this paper, we introduce and study the behavior of temporal and tag-based models for news article recommendation. Our experiments indicate that incorporating temporal and taginformation improves recommendation quality and increases user engagement. We argue through experimental evaluation that the improved performance is due to recommendation of more personalized news content by the tag-based recommendation algorithms as compared to other models that do not explicitly incorporate user-tag information."}}
