It has been shown that commonly used algorithms can produce overconfident posterior approximations. Balancing has empirically proven to be an effective way to mitigate this issue. However, its application remains limited to neural ratio estimation. In this work, we extend balancing to any algorithm that provides a posterior density. In particular, we introduce a balanced version of both neural posterior estimation and contrastive neural ratio estimation. We show empirically that the balanced versions tend to produce conservative posterior ap- proximations on a wide variety of benchmarks. In addition, we provide an alternative interpretation of the balancing condition in terms of the \u03c72 divergence."}}

(2021) show that current simulation-based inference algorithms can produce posteriors that are overconfident, hence risking false inferences. In this work, we introduce Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE), a variation of the NRE algorithm designed to produce posterior approximations that tend to be more conservative, hence improving their reliability, while sharing the same Bayes optimal solution. We achieve this by enforcing a balancing condition that increases the quantified uncertainty in small simulation budget regimes while still converging to the exact posterior as the budget increases. We provide theoretical arguments showing that BNRE tends to produce posterior surrogates that are more conservative than NRE's. We evaluate BNRE on a wide variety of tasks and show that it produces conservative posterior surrogates on all tested benchmarks and simulation budgets. Finally, we emphasize that BNRE is straightforward to implement over NRE and does not introduce any computational overhead."}}

Because the evaluation of the likelihood function requires evaluating millions of waveform models that link between signal shapes and the source parameters, running Markov chains until convergence is typically expensive and requires days of computation. In this extended abstract, we provide a proof of concept that demonstrates how the latest advances in neural simulation-based inference can speed up the inference time by up to three orders of magnitude -- from days to minutes -- without impairing the performance. Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network modeling the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and entirely amortizes the computation of the posterior. We find that our model correctly estimates credible intervals for the parameters of simulated gravitational waves."}}

Our results collected through months of experimental computations show that all benchmarked algorithms -- (S)NPE, (S)NRE, SNL and variants of ABC -- may produce overconfident posterior approximations, which makes them demonstrably unreliable and dangerous if one's scientific goal is to constrain parameters of interest. We believe that failing to address this issue will lead to a well-founded trust crisis in simulation-based inference. For this reason, we argue that research efforts should now consider theoretical and methodological developments of conservative approximate inference algorithms and present research directions towards this objective. In this regard, we show empirical evidence that ensembles are consistently more reliable."}}

Anchored ensembles approximate the posterior by training an ensemble of neural networks on anchored losses designed for the optima to follow the Bayesian posterior. Training an ensemble, however, becomes computationally expensive as its number of members grows since the full training procedure is repeated for each member. In this note, we present Sequential Anchored Ensembles (SAE), a lightweight alternative to anchored ensembles. Instead of training each member of the ensemble from scratch, the members are trained sequentially on losses sampled with high auto-correlation, hence enabling fast convergence of the neural networks and efficient approximation of the Bayesian posterior. SAE outperform anchored ensembles, for a given computational budget, on some benchmarks while showing comparable performance on the others and achieved 2nd and 3rd place in the light and extended tracks of the NeurIPS 2021 Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning competition."}}
