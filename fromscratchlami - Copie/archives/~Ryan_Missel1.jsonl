Compared to univariate time-series forecasting, this adds a new challenge of reasoning about the latent dynamics of an unobserved abstract state. Sequential latent variable models (LVMs) present an attractive solution, although existing works either struggle with long-term forecasting or have difficulty learning across diverse dynamics. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework of sequential LVMs to unify existing works, contrast their fundamental limitations, and identify an intuitive solution to long-term forecasting for diverse dynamics via meta-learning. We then present the first framework of few-shot forecasting for high-dimensional time-series: instead of learning a single dynamic function, we leverage data of diverse dynamics and learn to adapt latent dynamic functions to few-shot support series. This is realized via Bayesian meta-learning underpinned by: 1) a latent dynamic function conditioned on knowledge derived from few-shot support series, and 2) a meta-model that learns to extract such dynamic-specific knowledge via feed-forward embedding of support set. We compared the presented framework with a comprehensive set of baseline models trained 1) globally on the large meta-training set with diverse dynamics, and 2) individually on single dynamics, both with and without fine-tuning to k-shot support series used by the meta-models. We demonstrated that the presented framework is agnostic to the latent dynamic function of choice and, at meta-test time, is able to forecast for new dynamics given variable-shot of support series."}}

We argue that this is because existing approaches treat continually-arrived data independently, without considering how they are related based on the underlying semantic factors. We address this by a new generative model describing a topologically-connected mixture of spike-and-slab distributions in the latent space, learned end-to-end in a continual fashion via principled variational inference. The learned mixture is able to automatically discover the active semantic factors underlying each data environment and to accumulate their relational structure based on that. This distilled knowledge of different data environments can further be used for generative replay and guiding continual disentangling of new semantic factors. We tested the presented method on a split version of 3DShapes to provide the first quantitative disentanglement evaluation of continually learned representations, and further demonstrated its ability to continually disentangle new representations in benchmark datasets."}}

Modern deep learning approaches enable expressive modeling but rely on a large number of reconstructed images (labeled data) that are often not available in practice. To combine the best of the above two lines of works, we present a novel label-free image reconstruction network that is supervised by physics-based forward operators rather than labeled data. We further present an expressive yet disentangled spatial-temporal modeling of the inverse solution, where its latent dynamics is modeled by neural ordinary differential equations and its emission over non-Euclidean geometrical domains by graph convolutional neural networks. We applied the presented method to reconstruct electrical activity on the heart surface from body-surface potential. In simulation and real-data experiments in comparison to both traditional physics-based and modern data-driven reconstruction methods, we demonstrated the ability of the presented method to learn how to reconstruct using observational data without any corresponding labels."}}

Abstract Background Machine learning models may help localize the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia (VT) using 12-lead electrocardiograms. However, population-based models suffer from inter-subject anatomical variations within ECG data, while patient-specific models face the open challenge of what pacing data to collect for training. Methods This study presents and validates the first hybrid model that combines population and patient-specific machine learning for rapid \u201ccomputer-guided pace-mapping\u201d. A population-based deep learning model was first trained offline to disentangle inter-subject variations and regionalize the site of VT origin. Given a new patient with a target VT, an on-line patient-specific model -- after being initialized by the population-based prediction -- was then built in real time by actively suggesting where to pace next and improving the prediction with each added pacing data, progressively guiding pace-mapping towards the site of VT origin. Results The population model was trained on pace-mapping data from 38 patients and the patient-specific model was subsequently tuned on one patient. The resulting hybrid model was tested on a separate cohort of eight patients in localizing 1) 193 LV endocardial pacing sites, and 2) nine VTs with clinically determined exit sites. The hybrid model achieved a localization error of 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0mm using 5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 pacing sites in localizing LV pacing sites, achieving a significantly higher accuracy with a significantly smaller amount of training sites in comparison to models without active guidance. Conclusion The presented hybrid model has the potential to assist rapid pace-mapping of interventional targets in VT."}}
