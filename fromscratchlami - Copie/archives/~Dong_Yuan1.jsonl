Semi-supervised learning has been introduced into federated learning scenarios to address the lack of labels, but performance suffers from slow training and non-convergence in real network environments. In this article, we propose Federated Incremental Learning (FedIL) as a semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL) framework in edge computing to overcome the limitations of SSFL. FedIL introduces a group-based asynchronous training algorithm with provable convergence, which accelerates model training by allowing more clients to participate simultaneously. We developed a prototype system and performed track-driven simulations to demonstrate FedIL's superior performance."}}

In case of incidents such as natural disaster rescue, it provides vital guidance in real-time. However, due to the limited camera hardware and network bandwidth, noise are observed especially at night and the resolution is low. To tackle these two issues, we design and implement EADV, an Edge-Assisted Deep Video denoising and super-resolution system for real-time surveillance at night. We demonstrate the video quality enhancement using a camera, a displayer, and an edge server. The low-quality video captured by the camera is enhanced by the server and shown on the displayer. The enhanced real-time video is smooth and the performance uplift is observable."}}

However, current Federated Semi-Supervised/Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) approaches fail to learn large-scale images because of the limited computing resources of local clients. In this paper, we introduce a new framework FedMAE, which stands for Federated Masked AutoEncoder, to address the problem of how to utilize unlabeled large-scale images for FL. Specifically, FedMAE can pre-train one-block Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) using large images in lightweight client devices, and then cascades multiple pre-trained one-block MAEs in the server to build a multi-block ViT backbone for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on image reconstruction and classification show that our FedMAE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FSSL methods."}}

However, there is an essential question:\u201cCan the ground-truth labels be identified precisely?\". If yes, \u201cHow can the ground-truth labels be found?\". This paper provides affirmative answers to these questions. Instead of adopting hand-made heuristic strategy, we propose a novel Mutual Information Label Identification for Partial Multilabel Learning (MILI-PML), which is derived from a clear probabilistic formulation and could be easily interpreted theoretically from the mutual information perspective, as well as naturally incorporates the feature/label relevancy considerations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed MILI-PML."}}
