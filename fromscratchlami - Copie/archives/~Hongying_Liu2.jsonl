The stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) is a popular algorithm to solve such large-scale problems, and has been successfully used in many real-world applications. However, existing SADMMs fail to take into consideration an important issue in their designs, i.e., protecting sensitive information. To address this challenging issue, this paper proposes a novel differential privacy stochastic ADMM framework for solving equality constrained machine learning problems. In particular, to further lift the utility in privacy-preserving equality constrained optimization, a Laplacian smoothing operation is also introduced into our differential privacy ADMM framework, and it can smooth out the Gaussian noise used in the Gaussian mechanism. Then we propose an efficient differentially private variance reduced stochastic ADMM (DP-VRADMM) algorithm with Laplacian smoothing for both strongly convex and general convex objectives. As a by-product, we also present a new differentially private stochastic ADMM algorithm with DP guarantees. In theory, we provide both private guarantees and utility guarantees for the proposed algorithms, which show that Laplacian smoothing can improve the utility bounds of our algorithms. Experimental results on real-world datasets verify our theoretical results and the effectiveness of our algorithms."}}

Recently, the VSR methods based on deep neural networks have made great progress. However, there is rarely systematical review on these methods. In this survey, we comprehensively investigate 37 state-of-the-art VSR methods based on deep learning. It is well known that the leverage of information contained in video frames is important for video super-resolution. Thus we propose a taxonomy and classify the methods into seven sub-categories according to the ways of utilizing inter-frame information. Moreover, descriptions on the architecture design and implementation details are also included. Finally, we summarize and compare the performance of the representative VSR methods on some benchmark datasets. We also discuss the applications, and some challenges, which need to be further addressed by researchers in the community of VSR. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first systematic review on VSR tasks, and it is expected to make a contribution to the development of recent studies in this area and potentially deepen our understanding of the VSR techniques based on deep learning."}}

Recently, several stochastic variance reduced ADMM algorithms (e.g., SVRG-ADMM) have made exciting progress, such as linear convergence for strongly convex (SC) problems. However, SVRG-ADMM and its variants have an outer loop where the full gradient at the snapshot is computed, and their outer loop contains an inner loop, in which a large number of variance reduced gradients are estimated from random samples. This loopy design makes these methods more complex to analyze and determine the inner loop length, which must be proportional to the condition number to achieve best convergence, and is often set to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> as a suboptimal choice, where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the number of samples. To tackle these issues, we propose an efficient loopless variance reduced stochastic ADMM algorithm, called LVR-SADMM. In our LVR-SADMM, we remove the outer loop and replace it with a biased coin-flip, in which we update the snapshot with a small probability to trigger the full gradient computation. Moreover, we also theoretically analyze the convergence property of LVR-SADMM, which shows that it enjoys a fast linear convergence rate for SC problems. In particular, we also present an accelerated loopless SVRG-ADMM (LAVR-SADMM) method for both SC and non-SC problems. Various experimental results on many real-world data sets verify that the proposed methods can achieve an average speedup of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> in the SC case and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> in the non-SC case over their loopy counterparts, respectively."}}

The remote sensing images, especially polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), have provided wide applications for both military and civilian users regardless of weather or lighting conditions. However, the classification of heterogeneous imagery is still challenging. In this article, we propose a novel deep fuzzy graph convolutional network (DFGCN) for pixelwise classification of PolSAR imagery. Inspired by the fuzzy logic, the imagery (i.e., a reflection of the backscattering of the ground) is represented by a fuzzy graph, whose node is associated with a feature vector, and fuzzy weights denoting the similarity degrees between nodes are defined by using both feature distance and spatial relation. We also construct a new graph residual module stacking multiple residual layers to extend the depth of our fuzzy graph network. Moreover, we present a graph shrinking strategy to reduce the graph size for training and predicting the labels of large-scale PolSAR imagery, which can cut down the computational cost. The experimental results on various real-world PolSAR datasets indicate that DFGCN dramatically enhances classification accuracies on both heterogeneous and homogeneous regions with limited labeled pixels compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Until recently, previous works in this domain typically rely on learning a common space to match the text and video, but it is difficult to match due to the semantic gap between videos and texts. Although some methods employ coarse-to-fine or multi-expert networks to encode one or more common spaces for easier matching, they almost directly optimize one matching space, which is challenging, because of the huge semantic gap between different modalities. To address this issue, we aim at narrowing semantic gap by a progressive learning process with a coarse-to-fine architecture, and propose a novel Progressive Semantic Matching (PSM) method. We first construct a multilevel encoding network for videos and texts, and design some auxiliary common spaces, which are mapped by the outputs of encoders in different levels. Then all the common spaces are jointly trained end to end. In this way, the model can effectively encode videos and texts into a fusion common space by a progressive paradigm. Experimental results on three video-text datasets (i.e., MSR-VTT, TIGF and MSVD) demonstrate the advantages of our PSM, which achieves significant performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art approaches."}}

However, the performance of most convolutional neural networks (CNNs) degrades dramatically when only a few labeled training samples are available. As one well-known class of semi-supervised learning methods, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have gained much attention recently to address the classification problem with only a few labeled samples. As the number of layers grows in the network, the parameters dramatically increase. It is challenging to determine an optimal architecture manually. In this paper, we propose a neural architecture search method based GCN (ASGCN) for the classification of PolSAR images. We construct a novel graph whose nodes combines both the physical features and spatial relations between pixels or samples to represent the image. Then we build a new searching space whose components are empirically selected from some graph neural networks for architecture search and develop the differentiable architecture search method to construction our ASGCN. Moreover, to address the training of large-scale images, we present a new weighted mini-batch algorithm to reduce the computing memory consumption and ensure the balance of sample distribution, and also analyze and compare with other similar training strategies. Experiments on several real-world PolSAR datasets show that our method has improved the overall accuracy as much as 3.76% than state-of-the-art methods."}}
