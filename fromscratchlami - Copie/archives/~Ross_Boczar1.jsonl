As impressive as the empirical success of these methods have been, strong theoretical guarantees of performance, safety, or robustness are few and far between. This manuscript takes a step towards such providing such guarantees by establishing finite-data performance guarantees for identifying and controlling fully- or partially-unknown dynamical systems.In this manuscript, we explore three different viewpoints that each provide different quantitative guarantees of performance. First, we present a generalization of the classical theory of integral quadratic constraints. This generalization leads to a tractable computational procedure for finding exponential stability certificates for partially-unknown feedback systems. Second, we present non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds for core problems in the field of system identification. Finally, using the recently developed system-level synthesis framework and tools from high-dimensional statistics, we establish finite-sample performance guarantees for robust output-feedback control of an unknown dynamical system."}}

In particular, we show that simple models can be easily fit from input/output data and are sufficient for achieving various control objectives. We derive bounds on the number of noisy input/output samples from a stable linear time-invariant system that are sufficient to guarantee that the corresponding finite impulse response approximation is close to the true system in the $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$-norm. We demonstrate that these demands are lower than those derived in prior art which aimed to accurately identify dynamical models. We also explore how different physical input constraints, such as power constraints, affect the sample complexity.
