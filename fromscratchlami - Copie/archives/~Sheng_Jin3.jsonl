However, most existing algorithms focus on batch inputs and instance-balanced optimization, which is limited in the single datum input case and does not match the dynamic training in online hashing. Furthermore, constantly updating the online model with new-coming samples will inevitably lead to the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel online hashing method to handle the above-mentioned issues jointly, termed Asynchronus Teacher-Guided Bit-wise Hard Mining for Online Hashing. Firstly, to meet the needs of datum-wise online hashing, we design a novel binary codebook that is discriminative to separate different classes. Secondly, we propose a novel semantic loss (termed bit-wise attention loss) to dynamically focus on hard samples of each bit during training. Last but not least, we design a asynchronous knowledge distillation scheme to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem, where the teacher model is delaying updated to maintain the old knowledge, guiding the student model learning. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our method over the state-of-the-arts."}}

However, the existing general hashing methods have limited discriminative power for describing fine-grained objects that share similar overall appearance but have a subtle difference. To solve this problem, we for the first time introduce the attention mechanism to the learning of fine-grained hashing codes. Specifically, we propose a novel deep hashing model, named deep saliency hashing (DSaH), which automatically mines salient regions and learns semantic-preserving hashing codes simultaneously. DSaH is a two-step end-to-end model consisting of an attention network and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic components, including the semantic loss, the saliency loss, and the quantization loss. As the core of DSaH, the saliency loss guides the attention network to mine discriminative regions from pairs of images. We conduct extensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for performance evaluation. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford Flowers, Stanford Dogs, and CUB Birds demonstrate that our DSaH performs the best for the fine-grained retrieval task and beats the strongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 10% on both Stanford Dogs and CUB Birds. DSaH is also comparable to several state-of-the-art hashing methods on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE."}}

From the perspective of moment matching, most existing discrepancy-based methods are designed to match the second-order or lower moments, which however, have limited expression of statistical characteristic for non-Gaussian distributions. In this work, we propose a Higher-order Moment Matching (HoMM) method, and further extend the HoMM into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In particular, our proposed HoMM can perform arbitrary-order moment matching, we show that the first-order HoMM is equivalent to Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the second-order HoMM is equivalent to Correlation Alignment (CORAL). Moreover, HoMM (order\u2265 3) is expected to perform fine-grained domain alignment as higher-order statistics can approximate more complex, non-Gaussian distributions. Besides, we also exploit the pseudo-labeled target samples to learn discriminative representations in the target domain, which further improves the transfer performance. Extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed HoMM consistently outperforms the existing moment matching methods by a large margin.

However, these methods are mostly supervised. In real-world applications, it is a time-consuming and overloaded task for annotating a large number of images. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep hashing method for large-scale image retrieval. Our method, namely unsupervised semantic deep hashing ( USDH ), uses semantic information preserved in the CNN feature layer to guide the training of network. We enforce four criteria on hashing codes learning based on VGG-19 model: 1) preserving relevant information of feature space in hashing space; 2) minimizing quantization loss between binary-like codes and hashing codes; 3) improving the usage of each bit in hashing codes by using maximum information entropy, and 4) invariant to image rotation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, NUSWIDE have demonstrated that USDH outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods for image retrieval. We also conduct experiments on Oxford 17 datasets for fine-grained classification to verify its efficiency for other computer vision tasks."}}
