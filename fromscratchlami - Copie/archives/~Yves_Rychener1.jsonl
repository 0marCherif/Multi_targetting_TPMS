This means that the distributions of the predictions within the two groups should be close with respect to the Kolmogorov distance, and fairness is achieved by penalizing the dissimilarity of these two distributions in the objective function of the learning problem. In this paper, we showcase conceptual and computational benefits of measuring unfairness with integral probability metrics (IPMs) other than the Kolmogorov distance. Conceptually, we show that the generator of any IPM can be interpreted as a family of utility functions and that unfairness with respect to this IPM arises if individuals in the two demographic groups have diverging expected utilities. We also prove that the unfairness-regularized prediction loss admits unbiased gradient estimators if unfairness is measured by the squared $\\mathcal L^2$-distance or by a squared maximum mean discrepancy. In this case, the fair learning problem is susceptible to efficient stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. Numerical experiments on real data show that these SGD algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods for fair learning in that they achieve superior accuracy-unfairness trade-offs -- sometimes orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we identify conditions under which statistical parity can improve prediction accuracy."}}

In this paper, we outline limitations of this approach when using complex BERT-based classifiers: The word-based sampling produces texts that are out-of-distribution for the classifier and further gives rise to a high-dimensional search space, which can\u2019t be sufficiently explored when time or computation power is limited. Both of these challenges can be addressed by using segments as elementary building blocks for NLP interpretability. As illustration, we show that the simple choice of sentences greatly improves on both of these challenges. As a consequence, the resulting explainer attains much better fidelity on a benchmark classification task."}}

This makes evaluating interpretability approaches a pressing issue. There are multiple datasets for evaluating NLP Interpretability, but their dependence on human provided ground truths raises questions about their unbiasedness. In this work, we take a different approach and formulate a specific classification task by diverting question-answering datasets. For this custom classification task, the interpretability ground-truth arises directly from the definition of the classification problem. We use this method to propose a benchmark and lay the groundwork for future research in NLP interpretability by evaluating a wide range of current state of the art methods."}}
