Without sufficient diversity in the transformations used to create views, however, it can be difficult to overcome nuisance variables in the data and build rich representations. This motivates the use of the dataset itself to find similar, yet distinct, samples to serve as views for one another. In this paper, we introduce Mine Your Own vieW (MYOW), a new approach for self-supervised learning that looks within the dataset to define diverse targets for prediction. The idea behind our approach is to actively mine views, finding samples that are neighbors in the representation space of the network, and then predict, from one sample's latent representation, the representation of a nearby sample. After showing the promise of MYOW on benchmarks used in computer vision, we highlight the power of this idea in a novel application in neuroscience where SSL has yet to be applied. When tested on multi-unit neural recordings, we find that MYOW outperforms other self-supervised approaches in all examples (in some cases by more than 10%), and often surpasses the supervised baseline. With MYOW, we show that it is possible to harness the diversity of the data to build rich views and leverage self-supervision in new domains where augmentations are limited or unknown."}}

In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture for learning from time-varying data that builds descriptions of both the individual as well as the collective population dynamics. Rather than combining all of our data into our model at the onset, we develop a separable architecture that operates on individual time-series first before passing them forward; this induces a permutation-invariance property and can be used to transfer across systems of different size and order. After demonstrating that our model can be applied to successfully recover complex interactions and dynamics in many-body systems, we apply our approach to populations of neurons in the nervous system. On neural activity datasets, we show that our model not only yields robust decoding performance, but also provides impressive performance in transfer across recordings of different animals without any neuron-level correspondence.

How can we use our accelerating understanding of the brain to improve these and other aspects of ANNs? Here we hypothesize that (a) Brains employ synaptic plasticity rules that serve as proxies for GD; (b) These rules themselves can be learned by GD on the rule parameters; and (c) This process may be a missing ingredient for the development of ANNs that generalize well and are robust to adversarial perturbations. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence for this hypothesis. In our experiments, plasticity rules for the synaptic weights of recurrent neural nets (RNNs) are learned through GD and are found to perform reasonably well (with no backpropagation).  We find that plasticity rules learned by this process generalize from one type of data/classifier to others (e.g., rules learned on synthetic data work well on MNIST/Fashion MNIST) and converge with fewer updates. Moreover, the classifiers learned using plasticity rules exhibit surprising levels of tolerance to adversarial perturbations. In the special case of the last layer of a classification network, we show analytically that GD on the plasticity rule recovers (and improves upon) the perceptron algorithm and the multiplicative weights method. Finally, we argue that applying GD to learning rules is biologically plausible, in the sense that it can be learned over evolutionary time: we describe a genetic setting where natural selection of a numerical parameter over a sequence of generations provably simulates a simple variant of GD."}}
