It is mainly the case for fluid dynamics and the resolution of Navier\u2013Stokes equations. However, despite the fast-growing field of data-driven models for physical systems, reference datasets representing real-world phenomena are lacking. In this work, we develop \\textsc{AirfRANS}, a dataset for studying the two-dimensional incompressible steady-state Reynolds-Averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations over airfoils at a subsonic regime and for different angles of attacks. We also introduce metrics on the stress forces at the surface of geometries and visualization of boundary layers to assess the capabilities of models to accurately predict the meaningful information of the problem. Finally, we propose deep learning baselines on four machine learning tasks to study \\textsc{AirfRANS} under different constraints for generalization considerations: big and scarce data regime, Reynolds number, and angle of attack extrapolation."}}

While convolutional and fully connected operations have been widely studied in the literature, the design of pooling operations that handle action recognition, with different sources of temporal granularity in action categories, has comparatively received less attention, and existing solutions rely mainly on max or averaging operations. The latter are clearly powerless to fully exhibit the actual temporal granularity of action categories and thereby constitute a bottleneck in classification performances.In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical pooling design that captures different levels of temporal granularity in  action  recognition.  Our  design  principle  is  coarse-to-fine  and  achieved  using  a  tree-structured  network;  as  we traverse this network top-down, pooling operations are getting less invariant but timely more resolute and well localized.Learning the combination of operations in this network \u2014 which best fits a given ground-truth \u2014 is obtained by solving a constrained minimization problem whose solution corresponds to the distribution of weights that capture the contribution of each level (and thereby temporal granularity) in the global hierarchical pooling process. Besides being principled and well grounded, the proposed hierarchical pooling is also video-length and resolution agnostic. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging UCF-101, HMDB-51 and JHMDB-21 databases corroborate all these statements."}}

Current CNNs are increasingly deeper, data-hungrier and this makes their success tributary of the abundance of labeled training data. CNNs also rely on max/average pooling which reduces dimensionality of output layers and hence attenuates their sensitivity to the availability of labeled data. However, this process may dilute the information of upstream convolutional layers and thereby affect the discrimination power of the trained representations, especially when the learned categories are fine-grained. In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical aggregation design, for final pooling, that controls granularity of the learned representations w.r. t the actual granularity of action categories. Our solution is based on a tree-structured temporal pyramid that aggregates outputs of CNNs at different levels. Top levels of this hierarchy are dedicated to coarse categories while deep levels are more suitable to fine-grained ones. The design of our temporal pyramid is based on solving a constrained minimization problem whose solution corresponds to the distribution of weights of different representations in the temporal pyramid. Experiments conducted using the challenging UCF101 database show the relevance of our hierarchical design w.r. t other related methods."}}

These learning models were basically designed to handle vectorial data such as images but their extension to non-vectorial and semi-structured data  (namely  graphs  with  variable  sizes,  topology,  etc.)   remains  a  major  challenge,though a few interesting solutions are currently emerging.In this paper, we introduce MLGCN; a novel spectral Multi-Laplacian Graph Convolutional Network.  The main contribution of this method resides in a new design principle that learns graph-laplacians as convex combinations of other elementary laplacians\u2013each one dedicated to a particular topology of the input graphs. We also introduce a novel pooling operator, on graphs, that proceeds in two steps: context-dependent node expansion is achieved, followed by a global average pooling; the strength of this two-step process resides in its ability to preserve the discrimination power of nodes while achieving permutation invariance.  Experiments conducted on SBU and UCF-101 datasets, show the validity of our method for the challenging task of action recognition."}}
