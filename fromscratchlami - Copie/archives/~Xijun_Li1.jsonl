It is significant to develop efficient computational frameworks to solve this problem. In this article, an intelligent EOSs scheduling framework is developed using imitation learning based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The scheduling framework is composed of two processes: preprocessing, modeling, and solving process. In the preprocessing process, an analytical method to generate the available time windows of an EOS is derived after considering the effects of Earth's $J_{2}$ perturbation on the elliptic orbit. Based on the preprocessing results, this problem is formulated as an MILP model in the modeling process. In the solving process, a smart algorithm is proposed based on imitation learning for branch-and-bound to accelerate the solving process. Compared with normal imitation learning, a data selection method works in our algorithm to avoid potential misleading for learning. Besides, an iterative view is also adopted to improve the performance of the trained strategy. In the end, several real-world EOSs scheduling scenarios are investigated to demonstrate the reliability and high efficiency of this framework."}}

The data migration between storing tiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth control is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous research about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of bandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking optimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the system performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control in HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to formalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a learning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \\Pascal{}, which learns to control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative way. We implement \\Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three strong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical system shows that \\Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and greatly improve throughput stability (2X $\\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level."}}

Traditional prefetchers work well for mining access patterns of sequential logical block address (LBA) but cannot handle complex non-sequential patterns that commonly exist in real-world applications. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-based prefetchers cover more LBA accesses. However, they do not adequately consider the spatial interdependencies between LBA deltas, which leads to limited performance and robustness. This paper proposes a novel Stream-Graph neural network-based Data Prefetcher (SGDP). Specifically, SGDP models LBA delta streams using a weighted directed graph structure to represent interactive relations among LBA deltas and further extracts hybrid features by graph neural networks for data prefetching. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. Empirical results verify that SGDP outperforms the SOTA methods in terms of the hit ratio by 6.21%, the effective prefetching ratio by 7.00%, and speeds up inference time by 3.13X on average. Besides, we generalize SGDP to different variants by different stream constructions, further expanding its application scenarios and demonstrating its robustness. SGDP offers a novel data prefetching solution and has been verified in commercial hybrid storage systems in the experimental phase.

In this paper, we study the robustness of a combinatorial solver as a blackbox regardless it is classic or learning-based though the latter can often be more interesting to the ML community. Specifically, we develop a practically feasible robustness metric for general CO solvers. A no-worse optimal cost guarantee is developed as such the optimal solutions are not required to achieve for solvers, and we tackle the non-differentiable challenge in input instance disturbance by resorting to black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 14 unique combinations of solvers and CO problems, and we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi can degenerate by over 20% under the given time limit bound on the hard instances discovered by our robustness metric, raising concerns about the robustness of combinatorial optimization solvers."}}

Cut selection---which aims to select a proper subset of the candidate cuts to improve the efficiency of solving MILPs---heavily depends on (P1) which cuts should be preferred, and (P2) how many cuts should be selected. Although many modern MILP solvers tackle (P1)-(P2) by manually designed heuristics, machine learning offers a promising approach to learn more effective heuristics from MILPs collected from specific applications. However, many existing learning-based methods focus on learning which cuts should be preferred, neglecting the importance of learning the number of cuts that should be selected. Moreover, we observe from extensive empirical results that (P3) what order of selected cuts should be preferred has a significant impact on the efficiency of solving MILPs as well. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical sequence model (HEM) to learn cut selection policies via reinforcement learning. Specifically, HEM consists of a two-level model: (1) a higher-level model to learn the number of cuts that should be selected, (2) and a lower-level model---that formulates the cut selection task as a sequence to sequence learning problem---to learn policies selecting an ordered subset with the size determined by the higher-level model. To the best of our knowledge, HEM is the first method that can tackle (P1)-(P3) in cut selection simultaneously from a data-driven perspective. Experiments show that HEM significantly improves the efficiency of solving MILPs compared to human-designed and learning-based baselines on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILPs, including MIPLIB 2017. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that HEM well generalizes to MILPs that are significantly larger than those seen during training."}}

More important, the requirements and constraints in real manufacturing make the MP task very challenging in several aspects. For example, the MP needs to cover many production components of multiple plants over a 30-day horizon, which means that it involves a large number of decision variables. Furthermore, the MP task\u2019s two objectives have extremely different magnitudes, and some constraints are difficult to handle. Facing these uncompromising practical requirements, we introduce an interactive multiobjective optimization-based MP system in this article. It can help the decision maker reach a satisfactory tradeoff between the two objectives without consuming massive calculations. In the MP system, the submitted MP task is modeled as a multiobjective integer programming (MOIP) problem. Then, the MOIP problem is addressed via a two-stage multiobjective optimization algorithm (TSMOA). To alleviate the heavy calculation burden, TSMOA transforms the optimization of the MOIP problem into the optimization of a series of single-objective problems (SOPs). Meanwhile, a new SOP solving strategy is used in the MP system to further reduce the computational cost. It utilizes two sequential easier SOPs as the approximator of the original complex SOP for optimization. As part of the MP system, TSMOA and the SOP solving strategy are demonstrated to be efficient in real-world MP applications. In addition, the effectiveness of TSMOA is also validated on benchmark problems. The results indicate that TSMOA as well as the MP system are promising."}}
