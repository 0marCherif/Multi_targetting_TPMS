Our method is based on a sound mathematical framework, enjoys good properties, and is hyperparameter free. It is lightweight, since it does not require any re-training of the network, and it is flexible, since it can be used with any model that outputs soft-probabilities. We compare our solution to state-of-the-art methods considering popular benchmarks (Cifar-10, Cifar-100, SVHN), and various models (VGG-16, DenseNet-121, ResNet-34). At evaluation time, our method, which is applied post-training to any classification model, achieves similar or better results with respect to its competitors that usually require further training and/or tuning of the models."}}

A key feature of OOD detection is to exploit the network by extracting statistical patterns and relationships through the pre-trained multi-layer classifier. Despite achieving solid results, state-of-the-art methods require either additional OOD examples, expensive computation of gradients, or are tightened to a particular architecture, limiting their applications. This work adopts an original approach based on a functional view of the network that exploits the sample's trajectories through the various layers and their statistical dependencies. In this new framework, OOD detection translates into detecting samples whose trajectories differ from the typical behavior characterized by the training set. Our method significantly decreases the OOD detection error of classifiers trained on ImageNet and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on average AUROC and TNR at 95% TPR. We demonstrate that the functional signature left by a sample in a network carries relevant information for OOD detection. "}}

Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples that are statistically far from the training distribution, as they might cause failures of in-production systems. In this paper, we propose a new detector called TRUSTED. Different from previous works, TRUSTED key components (i) include a novel OOD score relying on the concept of statistical data depth, (ii) rely on the idea\u2019s full potential that all hidden layers of the network carry information regarding OOD. Our extensive experiments, comparing over 51k model configurations including different checkpoints, seed and various datasets, demonstrate that TRUSTED achieve state-of-the-art performances by producing an improvement of over 3 AUROC points."}}
