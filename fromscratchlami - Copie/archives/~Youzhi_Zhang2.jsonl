Offline RL proved very successful, paving a path to solving previously intractable real-world problems, and we aim to generalize this paradigm to a multi-agent or multiplayer-game setting. To this end, we formally introduce a problem of offline equilibrium finding (OEF) and construct multiple datasets across a wide range of games using several established methods. To solve the OEF problem, we design a model-based method that can directly apply any online equilibrium finding algorithm to the OEF setting while making minimal changes. We focus on three most prominent contemporary online equilibrium finding algorithms and adapt them to the OEF setting, creating three model-based variants: OEF-PSRO and OEF-CFR, which generalize the widely-used algorithms PSRO and Deep CFR to compute Nash equilibria (NEs), and OEF-JPSRO, which generalizes the JPSRO to calculate (Coarse) Correlated equilibria ((C)CEs). We further improve their performance by combining the behavior cloning policy with the model-based policy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over multiple model-based and model-free offline RL algorithms and the necessity of the model-based method for solving OEF problems. We hope that our efforts may help to accelerate research in large-scale equilibrium finding. "}}

We show that SockAttack compromises the F1-score of 4 well known review fraud detectors more than baselines on real world datasets (up to 28.8%).

Using logged data is imperative when further interaction with the environment is expensive (computationally or otherwise), unsafe, or entirely unfeasible. Offline RL proved very successful, paving a path to solving previously intractable real-world problems, and we aim to generalize this paradigm to a multi-agent or multiplayer-game setting. Very little research has been done in this area, as the progress is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and meaningful benchmarks. In this work, we coin the term offline equilibrium finding (OEF) to describe this area and construct multiple datasets consisting of strategies collected across a wide range of games using several established methods. We also propose a benchmark method -- an amalgamation of a behavior-cloning and a model-based algorithm. Our two model-based algorithms -- OEF-PSRO and OEF-CFR -- are adaptations of the widely-used equilibrium finding algorithms Deep CFR and PSRO in the context of offline learning. In the empirical part, we evaluate the performance of the benchmark algorithms on the constructed datasets.

However, in multiplayer games, computing a Nash equilibrium is generally hard, and the equilibria are not exchangeable, which makes players face the problem of selecting one of many different Nash equilibria. In this paper, we focus on an alternative solution concept in zero-sum multiplayer extensive-form games called Team-Maxmin Equilibrium (TME). It is a Nash equilibrium that maximizes each team member\u2019s utility. As TME is unique in general, it avoids the equilibrium selection problem. However, it is still difficult (FNP- hard) to find a TME. Computing it can be formulated as a non-convex program, but existing algorithms are capable of solving this program for only very small games. In this paper, we first refine the complexity result for computing a TME by using a correlation plan to show that a TME can be found in polynomial time in a specific class of games according to our boundary for complexity. Second, we propose an efficient correlation-based algorithm to solve the non-convex program for TME in games not belonging to this class. The algorithm combines two special correlation plans based on McCormick envelopes for convex relaxation and von Stengel-Forges polytope for correlated equilibria. We show that restricting the feasible solution space to von Stengel-Forges polytope will strictly reduce the feasible solution space after convex re- laxation of nonlinear terms. Finally, experiments show that our algorithm is about four orders of magnitude faster than the prior state of the art and can solve many previously unsolvable games."}}

While there exist many algorithms for computing solutions in two-player interactions, finding optimal strategies in multiplayer interactions efficiently remains an open challenge. This paper focuses on computing the multiplayer Team-Maxmin Equilibrium with Coordination device (TMECor) in zero-sum extensive-form games. TMECor models scenarios when a team of players coordinates ex ante against an adversary. Such situations can be found in card games (e.g., in Bridge and Poker), when a team works together to beat a target player but communication is prohibited; and also in real world, e.g., in forest-protection operations, when coordinated groups have limited contact during interdicting illegal loggers. The existing algorithms struggle to find a TMECor efficiently because of their high computational costs. To compute a TMECor in larger games, we make the following key contributions: (1) we propose a hybrid-form strategy representation for the team, which preserves the set of equilibria; (2) we introduce a column-generation algorithm with a guaranteed finite-time convergence in the infinite strategy space based on a novel best-response oracle; (3) we develop an associated-representation technique for the exact representation of the multilinear terms in the best-response oracle; and (4) we experimentally show that our algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than prior state-of-the-art algorithms in large games."}}

However, in many cases of the real world, agents are self-interested such as employees in a company and clubs in a league. Therefore, the leader, i.e., the manager of the company or the league, needs to provide bonuses to followers for efficient coordination, which we call expensive coordination. The main difficulties of expensive coordination are that i) the leader has to consider the long-term effect and predict the followers' behaviors when assigning bonuses and ii) the complex interactions between followers make the training process hard to converge, especially when the leader's policy changes with time. In this work, we address this problem through an event-based deep RL approach. Our main contributions are threefold. (1) We model the leader's decision-making process as a semi-Markov Decision Process and propose a novel multi-agent event-based policy gradient to learn the leader's long-term policy. (2) We exploit the leader-follower consistency scheme to design a follower-aware module and a follower-specific attention module to predict the followers' behaviors and make accurate response to their behaviors. (3) We propose an action abstraction-based policy gradient algorithm to reduce the followers' decision space and thus accelerate the training process of followers. Experiments in resource collections, navigation, and the predator-prey game reveal that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods dramatically."}}
