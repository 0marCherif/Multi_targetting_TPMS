Previous studies have used autoencoder and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to improve the quality of perceived image reconstruction from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, these methods mainly focus on acquiring relevant features between stimuli images and fMRI while ignoring the time-series information of fMRI, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a time-series information guided GAN method for reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activities. In addition, to better measure the modal difference, we leverage a pairwise ranking loss to rank the stimuli images and fMRI to ensure strongly associated pairs at the top and weakly related ones at the bottom. Experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that the proposed method achieves better performance in comparison with several state-of-the-art image reconstruction approaches."}}

Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality -- such as whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function -- such as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks -- including visual stimuli, decision making, flavor, and working memory -- confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms."}}

Most of the existing HA methods utilized unsupervised approaches, where they only maximized the correlation between the voxels with the same position in the time series. However, these unsupervised solutions may not be optimum for handling the functional alignment in the supervised MVP problems. This paper proposes a Supervised Hyperalignment (SHA) method to ensure better functional alignment for MVP analysis, where the proposed method provides a supervised shared space that can maximize the correlation among the stimuli belonging to the same category and minimize the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli. Further, SHA employs a generalized optimization solution, which generates the shared space and calculates the mapped features in a single iteration, hence with optimum time and space complexities for large datasets. Experiments on multi-subject datasets demonstrate that SHA method achieves up to 19% better performance for multi-class problems over the state-of-the-art HA algorithms."}}

Classical RSA techniques employ the inverse of the covariance matrix to explore a linear model between the neural activities and task events. However, calculating the inverse of a large-scale covariance matrix is time-consuming and can reduce the stability and robustness of the final analysis. Notably, it becomes severe when the number of samples is too large. For facing this shortcoming, this paper proposes a novel RSA method called gradient-based RSA (GRSA). Moreover, the proposed method is not restricted to a linear model. In fact, there is a growing interest in finding more effective ways of using multi-subject and whole-brain fMRI data. Searchlight technique can extend RSA from the localized brain regions to the whole-brain regions with smaller memory footprint in each process. Based on Searchlight, we propose a new method called Spatiotemporal Searchlight GRSA (SSL-GRSA) that generalizes our ROI-based GRSA algorithm to the whole-brain data. Further, our approach can handle some computational challenges while dealing with large-scale, multi-subject fMRI data. Experimental studies on multi-subject datasets confirm that both proposed approaches achieve superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms."}}

The inherent anatomical and functional variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other state-of-the-art functional alignment methods."}}

The WOC theory explains that the aggregate decision made by a group is often better than those of its individual members if specific conditions are satisfied. This paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised and semisupervised cluster ensemble by exploiting the WOC theory. We employ four conditions in the WOC theory, i.e., diversity, independency, decentralization, and aggregation, to guide both constructing of individual clustering results and final combination for clustering ensemble. First, independency criterion, as a novel mapping system on the raw data set, removes the correlation between features on our proposed method. Then, decentralization as a novel mechanism generates high quality individual clustering results. Next, uniformity as a new diversity metric evaluates the generated clustering results. Further, weighted evidence accumulation clustering method is proposed for the final aggregation without using thresholding procedure. Experimental study on varied data sets demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods."}}
