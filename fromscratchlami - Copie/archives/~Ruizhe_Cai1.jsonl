Thanks to its construction of resistance-less wires and ultrafast switches, it can operate at clock frequencies of several tens of gigahertz and even hundreds of thousands of times as energy efficient as its CMOS counterparts. It has been perceived to be an important candidate to replace stateof-the-art CMOS due to the superior potential in operation speed and energy efficiency, as recognized by the U.S. IARPA C3 and SuperTools Programs and Japan MEXT-JSPS Project. The design and fabrication of superconducting circuits have already been established [2]-[4]. In addition, a prototype superconducting microprocessor \"Core 1\" has been demonstrated in 2004 [3], which is able to execute instructions at a high clock frequency of several tens of gigahertz, and with extremely low-power dissipation. These achievements make superconducting electronics highly promising for future high-performance computing applications. As one of the most matured superconducting technology, the Rapid-Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) technology is proposed by K. Likharev, O. Mukhanoc, V. Semenov in 1985 [1]. Despite its capability to be operated at an ultra-high speed of hundreds of GHz while maintaining extremely low switching energy (10^-19 J), it suffers from an increasing static power due to on-chip resistors that are required for constant DC bias supply for the main RSFQ circuit. Numerous methods have been proposed to resolve the static power dissipation problem of RSFQ, including low-voltage RSFQ (LV-RSFQ) [5], reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) [6], LRbiased RSFQ [7] and energy-efficient single-flux quantum (eSFQ) [8]. The Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) technology, on the other hand, uses AC bias/excitation currents as both multiphase clock signal and power supply [9] to mitigate the power consumption overhead of DC bias while operating at a frequency of few GHz. Consequently, AQFP is remarkably energy efficient compared to RSFQ, albeit operating at a lower frequency. The energy-delay-product (EDP) of the AQFP circuits fabricated using processes such as the AIST standard process 2 (STP2) and the MIT-LL SFQ process [10], [11], is at least 200 times smaller than those of the other energy-efficient superconductor logics and is only three orders of magnitude larger than the quantum limit [9]. Physical testing results of an AQFP 8-bit carry-look-ahead adder and large scale circuits consisting up-to 10,000 AQFP logic gates have demonstrated the AQFP being a promising technology that is robust against circuit parameter variations [12]. Despite the high application potential of AQFP in VLSI circuits, a systematic, automatic synthesis framework for AQFP is imminent. There are two features of AQFP that restrict conventional CMOS synthesis methods being directly applied on AQFP. In spite of And-Or-Inverter(AOI) based representation, which conventional CMOS circuits highly relies on, AQFP circuits prefer majority gates. In fact, its two inputs AND and OR gates are also built with three inputs majority gate with one input being constant. In addition, given its clock-synchronized data propagation nature, AQFP technology requires all inputs to any gate having equal delay. In order to meet this balanced timing requirement, splitters and buffers need to be inserted to the circuit. As a matter of fact, some circuit size can be doubled even with optimum amount of buffers and splitters inserted. The buffer and splitter insertion method can have a huge impact on the overall resource consumption. As the design complexity increases, an unoptimized buffer and splitter insertion method could result in huge amount of unnecessary buffers and splitters added. In addition to a complete synthesis framework, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for AQFP design is also lacking. It is imminent to have an IDE for AQFP integrating tools that offer schematic and layout editor, simulation and analysis for better and more efficient AQFP design flow. In this paper, we propose a complete design tool for AQFP design including an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a complete majority based synthesis framework and a buffer and splitter insertion framework. we propose a majority gates synthesis framework for AQFP circuits that is capable of converting any AOI netlist to its corresponding MAJ netlist by mapping all feasible three-input sub-netlists to corresponding MAJ based implementations. In addition, we also propose an automated buffer and splitter insertion method that is capable of adding the optimum amount of buffers and splitters to any given gate-level netlist. The proposed method can find the minimum amount of buffers and splitters to inserted to achieve equal delay with any library limitation on the size of splitters. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods can deliver very optimized results. The majority conversion tool can reduce circuit size by an average of 16:47% and delay by 30:21% in average. The buffer and splitter insertion tool only introduces an average of 14:24% overhead in size and 4:70% delay with splitter fanout size limited to 4 compared to an unachievable ideal results with no limitations on splitter fan-out size. Overall, the balanced design in majority gates can be reduced by 23:85% and 29:54% in size and delay compared to its AND/OR/Inverter implemented counterpart."}}

The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits. Experimental results suggest that the proposed SC-based DNN using AQFP can achieve up to 6.8 \u00d7 104 times higher energy efficiency compared to CMOS-based implementation while maintaining 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset."}}

The computation of DCNNs is memory intensive due to large feature maps and neuron connections, and the performance highly depends on the capability of hardware resources. With the recent trend of wearable devices and Internet of Things, it becomes desirable to integrate the DCNNs onto embedded and portable devices that require low power and energy consumptions and small hardware footprints. Recently stochastic computing (SC)-DCNN demonstrated that SC as a low-cost substitute to binary-based computing radically simplifies the hardware implementation of arithmetic units and has the potential to satisfy the stringent power requirements in embedded devices. In SC, many arithmetic operations that are resource-consuming in binary designs can be implemented with very simple hardware logic, alleviating the extensive computational complexity. It offers a colossal design space for integration and optimization due to its reduced area and soft error resiliency. In this paper, we present HEIF, a highly efficient SC-based inference framework of the large-scale DCNNs, with broad applications including (but not limited to) LeNet-5 and AlexNet, that achieves high energy efficiency and low area/hardware cost. Compared to SC-DCNN, HEIF features: 1) the first (to the best of our knowledge) SC-based rectified linear unit activation function to catch up with the recent advances in software models and mitigate degradation in application-level accuracy; 2) the redesigned approximate parallel counter and optimized stochastic multiplication using transmission gates and inverse mirror adders; and 3) the new optimization of weight storage using clustering. Most importantly, to achieve maximum energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy, HEIF considers holistic optimizations on cascade connection of function blocks in DCNN, pipelining technique, and bit-stream length reduction. Experimental results show that in large-scale applications HEIF outperforms previous SC-DCNN by the throughput of 4.1\u00d7, by area efficiency of up to 6.5\u00d7, and achieves up to 5.6\u00d7 energy improvement."}}

By introducing weights associated with conditioned probability distributions, BNNs are capable of resolving the overfitting issue commonly seen in conventional neural networks and allow for small-data training, through the variational inference process. Frequent usage of Gaussian random variables in this process requires a properly optimized Gaussian Random Number Generator (GRNG). The high hardware cost of conventional GRNG makes the hardware implementation of BNNs challenging. In this paper, we propose VIBNN, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator design for variational inference on BNNs. We explore the design space for massive amount of Gaussian variable sampling tasks in BNNs. Specifically, we introduce two high performance Gaussian (pseudo) random number generators: the RAM-based Linear Feedback Gaussian Random Number Generator (RLF-GRNG), which is inspired by the properties of binomial distribution and linear feedback logics; and the Bayesian Neural Network-oriented Wallace Gaussian Random Number Generator. To achieve high scalability and efficient memory access, we propose a deep pipelined accelerator architecture with fast execution and good hardware utilization.

Hence the memristor crossbar technology can potentially be utilized for developing low-complexity and high-scalability solution frameworks for solving a large class of convex optimization problems, which involve extensive matrix operations and have critical applications in multiple disciplines. This paper, as the first attempt towards this direction, proposes a novel memristor crossbar-based framework for solving two important convex optimization problems, i.e., second-order cone programming (SOCP) and homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems. In this paper, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted. It splits the SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems into sub-problems that involve the solution of linear systems, which could be effectively solved using the memristor crossbar in O(1) time complexity. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that iterates a constant number of times. Therefore, algorithms to solve SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems have pseudo-O(N) complexity, which is a significant reduction compared to the state-of-the-art software solvers (O(N^3.5) - O(N^4))."}}
