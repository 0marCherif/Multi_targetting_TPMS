However, maximum likelihood training of flows is challenging due to the need to calculate computationally expensive determinants of Jacobians. This paper takes steps towards addressing this challenge by introducing objectives and model architectures for determinant-free training of flows. Central to our framework is the energy objective, a multidimensional extension of proper scoring rules that admits efficient estimators based on random projections. The energy objective does not require calculating determinants and therefore supports general flow architectures that are not well-suited to maximum likelihood training. In particular, we introduce semi-autoregressive flows, an architecture that can be trained with the energy loss, and that interpolates between fully autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, capturing the benefits of both. We empirically demonstrate that energy flows achieve competitive generative modeling performance while maintaining fast generation and posterior inference."}}

Semi-parametric architectures are typically more compact than parametric models, but their computational complexity is often quadratic. In contrast, SPIN attains linear complexity via a cross-attention mechanism between datapoints inspired by inducing point methods. Querying large training sets can be particularly useful in meta-learning, as it unlocks additional training signal, but often exceeds the scaling limits of existing models. We use SPIN as the basis of the Inducing Point Neural Process, a probabilistic model which supports large contexts in meta-learning and achieves high accuracy where existing models fail. In our experiments, SPIN reduces memory requirements, improves accuracy across a range of meta-learning tasks, and improves state-of-the-art performance on an important practical problem, genotype imputation."}}

In this paper, we expand this learning paradigm to stochastic orders, namely, the convex or Choquet order between probability measures. Towards this end, exploiting the relation between convex orders and optimal transport, we introduce the Choquet-Toland distance between probability measures, that can be used as a drop-in replacement for IPMs. We also introduce the Variational Dominance Criterion (VDC) to learn probability measures with dominance constraints, that encode the desired stochastic order between the learned measure and a known baseline. We analyze both quantities and show that they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and propose surrogates via input convex maxout networks (ICMNs), that enjoy parametric rates. We provide a min-max framework for learning with stochastic orders and validate it experimentally on synthetic and high-dimensional image generation, with promising results. Finally, our ICMNs class of convex functions and its derived Rademacher Complexity are of independent interest beyond their application in convex orders. Code to reproduce experimental results is available at https://github.com/yair-schiff/stochastic-orders-ICMN."}}

However, despite these successes, the recent Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning (PGDL) NeurIPS 2020 competition suggests that there is a need for more robust and efficient measures of network generalization. In this work, we propose a new framework for evaluating the generalization capabilities of trained networks. We use perturbation response (PR) curves that capture the accuracy change of a given network as a function of varying levels of training sample perturbation. From these PR curves, we derive novel statistics that capture generalization capability. Specifically, we introduce two new measures for accurately predicting generalization gaps: the Gi-score and Pal-score, which are inspired by the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio (measures of income inequality), that accurately predict generalization gaps. Using our framework applied to intra and inter-class sample mixup, we attain better predictive scores than the current state-of-the-art measures on a majority of tasks in the PGDL competition. In addition, we show that our framework and the proposed statistics can be used to capture to what extent a trained network is invariant to a given parametric input transformation, such as rotation or translation. Therefore, these generalization gap prediction statistics also provide a useful means for selecting optimal network architectures and hyperparameters that are invariant to a certain perturbation."}}

Specifically, Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) are generative models in which encoder-decoder network pairs are trained to reconstruct training data distributions in such a way that the latent space of the encoder network is smooth. Therefore, novel candidates can be found by sampling from this latent space. However, the scope of architectures and hyperparameters is vast and choosing the best combination for in silico discovery has important implications for downstream success. Therefore, it is important to develop a principled methodology for distinguishing how well a given generative model is able to learn salient molecular features. In this work, we propose a method for measuring how well the latent space of deep generative models is able to encode structural and chemical features of molecular datasets by correlating latent space metrics with metrics from the field of topological data analysis (TDA). We apply our evaluation methodology to a VAE trained on SMILES strings and show that 3D topology information is consistently encoded throughout the latent space of the model."}}
