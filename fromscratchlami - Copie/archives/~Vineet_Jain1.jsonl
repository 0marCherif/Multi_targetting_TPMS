Whereas prior work on exploiting symmetries in deep RL can only incorporate predefined linear transformations, our approach allows for non-linear symmetry transformations of state-action pairs to be learned from the data itself. This is achieved through an equivariant Lie algebraic parameterization of state and action encodings, equivariant latent transition models, and the use of symmetry-based losses. We demonstrate the advantages of our learned equivariant representations for Atari games, in a data-efficient setting limited to 100k steps of interactions with the environment. Our method, which we call Equivariant representations for RL (EqR), outperforms many previous methods in a similar setting by achieving a median human-normalized score of 0.418, and surpassing human-level performance on 8 out of the 26 games."}}

In the present article, we take advantage of the relationships between samples in a mini-batch, using graph neural networks to aggregate information from similar images. This helps mitigate the adverse effects of alterations to the input images on classification performance. Diverse experiments on image-based object and scene classification show that this approach not only improves a classifier's performance but also increases its robustness to image perturbations and adversarial attacks. Further, we also show that mini-batch graph neural networks can help to alleviate the problem of mode collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks."}}

In this paper, we present a data efficient learning framework using the recent concept of Generative Adversarial Networks; this allows a deep neural network to perform significantly better than its fully supervised counterpart in low annotation regime. The proposed method is an extension of our previous work with the addition of a new unsupervised adversarial loss and a structured prediction based architecture. Though generic, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for retinal blood vessels segmentation from fundus images on DRIVE and STARE datasets. We experiment with extreme low annotation budget and we show, that under this constrained data setting, the proposed method outperforms our previous method and other fully supervised benchmark models. In addition, our systematic ablation studies suggest some key observations for successfully training GAN based semi-supervised algorithms with an encoder-decoder style network architecture."}}

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an adversarial framework based structured prediction model for medical image segmentation. Though generic, we apply our method for segmentation of blood vessels in retinal fundus images. We experiment with extreme low annotation budget (0.8 - 1.6% of contemporary annotation size). On DRIVE and STARE datasets, the proposed method outperforms our previous method and other fully supervised benchmark models by significant margins especially with very low number of annotated examples. In addition, our systematic ablation studies suggest some key recipes for successfully training GAN based semi-supervised algorithms with an encoder-decoder style network architecture."}}
