Prior works mainly concentrate on the policy change cross episodes, ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from sudden policy change within an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance. We formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some agents to coordinate with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be changed within one episode. Then we develop a new framework Fast teammates adaptation (Fastap) to address the problem. Concretely, we first train versatile teammates' policies and assign them to different clusters via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to coordinate with the sampled uncontrolled teammates by capturing their identifications as context for fast adaptation. Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates' context for decision-making accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a robust policy that can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution phase. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior performance than multiple baselines in stationary and non-stationary scenarios. "}}

A popular algorithm configuration tuning paradigm is dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC), in which an agent learns dynamic configuration policies across instances by reinforcement learning (RL). However, in many complex algorithms, there may exist different types of configuration hyperparameters, and such heterogeneity may bring difficulties for classic DAC which uses a single-agent RL policy. In this paper, we aim to address this issue and propose multi-agent DAC (MA-DAC), with one agent working for one type of configuration hyperparameter. MA-DAC formulates the dynamic configuration of a complex algorithm with multiple types of hyperparameters as a contextual multi-agent Markov decision process and solves it by a cooperative multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm. To instantiate, we apply MA-DAC to a well-known optimization algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems. Experimental results show the effectiveness of MA-DAC in not only achieving superior performance compared with other configuration tuning approaches based on heuristic rules, multi-armed bandits, and single-agent RL, but also being capable of generalizing to different problem classes. Furthermore, we release the environments in this paper as a benchmark for testing MARL algorithms, with the hope of facilitating the application of MARL."}}

However, BO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and scaling it to high-dimensional problems is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a variable selection method MCTS-VS based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to iteratively select and optimize a subset of variables. That is, MCTS-VS constructs a low-dimensional subspace via MCTS and optimizes in the subspace with any BO algorithm. We give a theoretical analysis of the general variable selection method to reveal how it can work. Experiments on high-dimensional synthetic functions and real-world problems (e.g., MuJoCo locomotion tasks) show that MCTS-VS equipped with a proper BO optimizer can achieve state-of-the-art performance."}}

However, in many real-world scenarios, e.g., navigating in complex environments and controlling robots, one may need to find a set of policies having both high rewards and diverse behaviors, which can bring better exploration and robust few-shot adaptation. Recently, some methods have been developed by using evolutionary techniques, including iterative reproduction and selection of policies. However, due to the inefficient selection mechanisms, these methods cannot fully guarantee both high quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose EDO-CS, a new Evolutionary Diversity Optimization algorithm with Clustering-based Selection. In each iteration, the policies are divided into several clusters based on their behaviors, and a high-quality policy is selected from each cluster for reproduction. EDO-CS also adaptively balances the importance between quality and diversity in the reproduction process. Experiments on various (i.e., deceptive and multi-modal) continuous control tasks, show the superior performance of EDO-CS over previous methods, i.e., EDO-CS can achieve a set of policies with both high quality and diversity efficiently while previous methods cannot."}}

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose derivative-free optimization algorithms with a good ability to find the global optimum, which can be naturally applied to non-convex optimization. Their performance is, however, limited due to low efficiency. Gradient descent (GD) runs efficiently, but only converges to a first-order stationary point, which may be a saddle point and thus arbitrarily bad. Some recent efforts have been put into combining EAs and GD. However, previous works either utilized only a specific component of EAs, or just combined them heuristically without theoretical guarantee. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary GD (EGD) algorithm by combining typical components, i.e., population and mutation, of EAs with GD. We prove that EGD can converge to a second-order stationary point by escaping the saddle points, and is more efficient than previous algorithms. Empirical results on non-convex synthetic functions as well as reinforcement learning (RL) tasks also show its superiority."}}

BO usually models the objective function by a Gaussian process (GP), and iteratively samples the next data point by maximizing an acquisition function. In this paper, we propose a new general framework for BO by generating pseudo-points (i.e., data points whose objective values are not evaluated) to improve the GP model. With the classic acquisition function, i.e., upper confidence bound (UCB), we prove that the cumulative regret can be generally upper bounded. Experiments using UCB and other acquisition functions, i.e., probability of improvement (PI) and expectation of improvement (EI), on synthetic as well as real-world problems clearly show the advantage of generating pseudo-points."}}
