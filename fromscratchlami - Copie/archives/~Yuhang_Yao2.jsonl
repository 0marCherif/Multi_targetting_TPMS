Manually setting up these rules for smart devices or applications, however, is time-consuming and inefficient. Rule recommendation systems can automatically suggest rules for users by learning which rules are popular based on those previously deployed (e.g., in others' smart homes). Conventional recommendation formulations require a central server to record the rules used in many users' homes, which compromises their privacy. Moreover, these solutions typically leverage generic user-item matrix methods but do not fully exploit the structure of the rule recommendation problem. In this paper, we propose a new rule recommendation system, dubbed as FedRule, to address these challenges. One graph is constructed per user upon the rules s/he is using, and the rule recommendation is formulated as a link prediction task in these graphs. This formulation enables us to design a federated training algorithm that is able to keep users' data private. Extensive experiments corroborate our claims by demonstrating that FedRule has comparable performance to the centralized setting and outperforms conventional solutions."}}

Assigning the right tasks to the right users, however, is a longstanding challenge: different users will be better suited for different tasks, which in turn will have different contributions to the overall crowdsourcing goal. Even worse, these relationships are generally unknown a priori and may change over time, particularly in mobile settings. The diversity of devices in the Internet of Things and diversity of new application tasks that they may run exacerbate these challenges. Thus, in this paper, we formulate the mobile crowdsourcing problem as a Contextual Combinatorial Volatile Multi-armed Bandit problem. Although prior work has attempted to learn the optimal user-task assignment based on user-specific side information, such formulations assume known structure in the relationships between contextual information, user suitability for each task, and the overall crowdsourcing goal. To relax these assumptions, we propose a Neural-MAB algorithm that can learn these relationships. We show that in a simulated mobile crowdsourcing application, our algorithm significantly outperforms existing multi-armed bandit baselines in settings with both known and unknown reward structures."}}

Recent variants on traditional GCN models aim to classify nodes in dynamic graphs whose topologies and node attributes change over time, e.g., social networks with dynamic relationships. These works, however, do not fully address the challenge of flexibly assigning different importance to snapshots of the graph at different times, which depending on the graph dynamics may have more or less predictive power on the labels. We address this challenge by proposing a new method, GCN-SE, that attaches a set of learnable attention weights to graph snapshots at different times, inspired by Squeeze and Excitation Net (SE-Net). We show that GCNSE outperforms previously proposed node classification methods on a variety of graph datasets. To verify the effectiveness of the attention weight in determining the importance of different graph snapshots, we adapt perturbation-based methods from the field of explainable machine learning to graphical settings and evaluate the correlation between the attention weights learned by GCN-SE and the importance of different snapshots over time."}}

We first propose a dynamic stochastic block model that captures these changes, and a simple decay-based clustering algorithm that clusters nodes based on weighted connections between them, where the weight decreases at a fixed rate over time. This decay rate can then be interpreted as signifying the importance of including historical connection information in the clustering. However, the optimal decay rate may differ for clusters with different rates of turnover. We characterize the optimal decay rate for each cluster and propose a clustering method that achieves almost exact recovery of the true clusters. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our clustering algorithm with optimized decay rates on simulated graph data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a popular algorithm for sequence learning, use a similar decay-based method, and we use this insight to propose two new RNN-GCN (graph convolutional network) architectures for semi-supervised graph clustering. We finally demonstrate that the proposed architectures perform well on real data compared to state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms."}}

However, how to theoretically model such networks, along with quantitive characterizations, remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving model, which, as validated by our empirical results, can well capture some basic properties such as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter, and community structure embodied in most real datasets. Particularly, two types of results are presented in this paper. First, our proposed model, namely, evolving K-Graph, consists of K-node sets representing K different types of entities. The hybrid interactions among entities, based on whether they belong to the same type, are classified into inter-type and intra-type ones that are, respectively, characterized by two joint graphs evolving over time. Following our newly proposed mechanism called interactive-evolution, potential connections can be established among nodes with common features and further form a positive feedback. The superiorities of our model are three folded: good capture of realistic networks, mathematical tractability and efficient implementation. Second, by analytical derivations, along with empirical validation on real datasets, we disclose two aspects of network properties: basic ones as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter and community structure, as well as a distinctive one, that is, positive correlation observed in real networks, implying that a hub in one inter-type relationship network also has many neighbors in another one. An additional interesting finding is that through further comparison of models with or without interactive-evolution, the former one leads to an even earlier occurrence of network connectivity."}}

Prior works are mainly based on formulating it into a location-aware influence maximization problem in Geo-social Networks (GSNs), where $K$ initial seed individuals are selected in hope of maximizing the number of final influenced users. In this paper, we present the first look into the group-level location promotion, which can potentially enhance its performance, with the phenomenon that users belonging to the same geo-community share similar moving preferences. We propose GLP, a new and novel framework of group-level location promotion by virtue of geo-communities, each of which is treated as a group in GSNs. Aiming to attract more users to designated locations, GLP firstly carries out user grouping through an iterative learning approach based on information extraction from massive check-ins records. The advantage of GLP is three-folded: i) by aggregating movements of group members, GLP significantly avoids the sparsity and sporadicity of individual check-ins, and thus obtains more reliable mobility models; ii) by generalizing a new group-level social graph, GLP can exponentially reduce the computational complexity of seed nodes selection that is algorithmically executed by a greedy algorithm; iii) in comparison with prior individual-level cases, GLP is theoretically demonstrated to drastically increase influence spread under the same given budget. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the GLP outperforms four baselines, with notably up to 10 times larger influence spread and 100 times faster seed selection over two individual-level cases, meanwhile verifying the impact of group numbers in final influence spread."}}
