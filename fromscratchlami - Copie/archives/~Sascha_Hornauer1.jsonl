Therefore, we collected the BatVision dataset to provide large-scale echoes in complex real-world scenes to the community. We equipped a robot with a speaker to emit chirps and a binaural microphone to record their echoes. Synchronized RGB-D images from the same perspective provide visual labels of traversed spaces. We sampled modern US office spaces to historic French university grounds, indoor and outdoor with large architectural variety.

While showing promising results the drawback lies in the difficulty of safety verification and ensuring operation as intended. The aim of this paper is to increase safety when using neural networks, by proposing a monitoring framework based on novelty estimation of incoming driving data. The idea is to use unsupervised instance discrimination to learn a similarity measure across ego-vehicle camera images. By estimating a von Mises-Fisher distribution of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">expected</i> ego-camera images they can be compared with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unexpected</i> novel images. A novelty measurement is inferred through the likelihood of test frames belonging to the expected distribution. The suggested method provides competitive results to several other novelty or anomaly detection algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. It also shows promising results on real world driving scenarios by distinguishing novel driving scenes from the training data of BDD100 k. Applied on the identical training-test data split, the method is also able to predict the performance profile of a segmentation network. Finally, examples are provided on how this method can be extended to find novel segments in images."}}

However, DRL is notoriously limited by its high sample complexity and its lack of stability. Prior knowledge, e.g. as expert demonstrations, is often available but challenging to leverage to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we propose General Reinforced Imitation (GRI), a novel method which combines benefits from exploration and expert data and is straightforward to implement over any off-policy RL algorithm. We make one simplifying hypothesis: expert demonstrations can be seen as perfect data whose underlying policy gets a constant high reward. Based on this assumption, GRI introduces the notion of offline demonstration agents. This agent sends expert data which are processed both concurrently and indistinguishably with the experiences coming from the online RL exploration agent. We show that our approach enables major improvements on vision-based autonomous driving in urban environments. We further validate the GRI method on Mujoco continuous control tasks with different off-policy RL algorithms. Our method ranked first on the CARLA Leaderboard and outperforms World on Rails, the previous state-of-the-art, by 17%."}}

To achieve this, our sound-to-vision model processes binaural echo-returns from chirping sounds. We build upon previous work with BatVision that consists of a sound-to-vision model and a self-collected dataset using our mobile robot and low-cost hardware. We improve on the previous model by introducing several changes to the model, which leads to a better depth and grayscale estimation, and increased perceptual quality. Rather than using raw binaural waveforms as input, we generate generalized cross-correlation (GCC) features and use these as input instead. In addition, we change the model generator and base it on residual learning and use spectral normalization in the discriminator. We compare and present both quantitative and qualitative improvements over our previous BatVision model."}}

Network models, trained on big data, map input to probable prediction results. However, it is unclear how to get a measure of confidence on this prediction at the test time.Our approach to gain this additional information is to estimate how similar test data is to the training data that the model was trained on. We map training instances onto a feature space that is the most discriminative among them. We then model the entire training set as a Gaussian distribution in that feature space. The novelty of the test data is characterized by its low probability of being in that distribution, or equivalently a large Mahalanobis distance in the feature space.Our distance metric in the discriminative feature space achieves a better novelty prediction performance than the state-of-the-art methods on most classes in CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Using semantic segmentation as a proxy task often needed for autonomous driving, we show that our unsupervised novelty prediction correlates with the performance of a segmentation network trained on full pixel-wise annotations. These experimental results demonstrate potential applications of our method upon identifying scene familiarity and quantifying the confidence in autonomous driving actions."}}

Radar and ultrasound complement camera-based vision but they are often too costly and complex to set up for very limited information gain. In nature, sound is used effectively by bats, dolphins, whales, and humans for navigation and communication. However, it is unclear how to best harness sound for machine perception.Inspired by bats' echolocation mechanism, we design a low- cost BatVision system that is capable of seeing the 3D spatial layout of space ahead by just listening with two ears. Our system emits short chirps from a speaker and records returning echoes through microphones in an artificial human pinnae pair. During training, we additionally use a stereo camera to capture color images for calculating scene depths. We train a model to predict depth maps and even grayscale images from the sound alone. During testing, our trained BatVision provides surprisingly good predictions of 2D visual scenes from two 1D audio signals. Such a sound to vision system would benefit robot navigation and machine vision, especially in low-light or no-light conditions. Our code and data are publicly available."}}
