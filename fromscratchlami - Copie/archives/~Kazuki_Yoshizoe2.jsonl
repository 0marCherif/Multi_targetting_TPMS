In this paper, we propose to optimize image recognition models and data augmentation policies simultaneously to improve the performance using gradient descent. Unlike prior methods, our approach avoids using proxy tasks or reducing search space, and can directly improve the validation performance. Our method achieves efficient and scalable training by approximating the gradient of policies by implicit gradient with Neumann series approximation. We demonstrate that our approach can improve the performance of various image classification tasks, including fine-grained image recognition, without using dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning."}}

The purpose of de novo molecular generation is to generate instead of search. Existing machine learning based molecular design methods have no or limited ability in generating novel molecules that preserves a target substructure. Our Graph Energy-based Model, or GEM, can fix substructures and generate the rest. The experimental results show that the GEMs trained from chemistry datasets successfully generate novel molecules while preserving the target substructures. This method would provide a new way of incorporating the domain knowledge of chemists in molecular design."}}

However, while massively parallel computing is often used for training models, it is rarely used to search solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. This paper proposes a novel massively parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MP-MCTS) algorithm that works efficiently for a 1,000 worker scale on a distributed memory environment using multiple compute nodes and applies it to molecular design. This paper is the first work that applies distributed MCTS to a real-world and non-game problem. Existing works on large-scale parallel MCTS show efficient scalability in terms of the number of rollouts up to 100 workers. Still, they suffer from the degradation in the quality of the solutions. MP-MCTS maintains the search quality at a larger scale. By running MP-MCTS on 256 CPU cores for only 10 minutes, we obtained candidate molecules with similar scores to non-parallel MCTS running for 42 hours. Moreover, our results based on parallel MCTS (combined with a simple RNN model) significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art work. Our method is generic and is expected to speed up other applications of MCTS."}}

As the majority of CASP programs have been designed to provide one or a few optimal routes, it is likely that the desired one will not be included. To avoid this, an exact algorithm that lists possible synthetic routes within the chemical reaction network is required, alongside a recommendation of synthetic routes that meet specified criteria based on the chemist\u2019s objectives. Herein, we propose a chemical-reaction-network-based synthetic route recommendation framework called \u201cCompRet\u201d with a mathematically guaranteed enumeration algorithm. In a preliminary experiment, CompRet was shown to successfully provide alternative routes for a known antihistaminic drug, cetirizine. CompRet is expected to promote desirable enumeration-based chemical synthesis searches and aid the development of an interactive CASP framework for chemists."}}

Recently, several studies have shown that augmentation strategies found by search algorithms outperform hand-made strategies. Such methods employ black-box search algorithms over image transformations with continuous or discrete parameters and require a long time to obtain better strategies. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy search pipeline for data augmentation, which is much faster than previous methods. We introduce approximate gradients for several transformation operations with discrete parameters as well as a differentiable mechanism for selecting operations. As the objective of training, we minimize the distance between the distributions of augmented and original data, which can be differentiated. We show that our method, Faster AutoAugment, achieves significantly faster searching than prior methods without a performance drop."}}

This work exploits the characteristics of two processing modes, synchronous and asynchronous, in the context of the shared-memory NUMA platform. Depending on the algorithm, phase of execution, and graph topology, synchronous and asynchronous modes hold unique advantages over one another. We then explore a hybrid solution that combines synchronous and asynchronous processing within the same graph computation task and harness optimizations therein. An extensive evaluation using graphs with billions of edges and empirical comparisons with several state-of-the-art solutions demonstrate the performance advantages of our design."}}
