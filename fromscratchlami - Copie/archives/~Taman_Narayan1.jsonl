We show these shape constraints can be checked and even enforced when training machine-learned models for linear models, generalized additive models, and the nonlinear function class of multi-layer lattice models. Real-world experiments illustrate how the different shape constraints can be used to increase explainability and improve regularization, especially for non-IID train-test distribution shift."}}
