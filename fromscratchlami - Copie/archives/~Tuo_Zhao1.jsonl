In this paper, we take such low-dimensional data structures into consideration by assuming that data distributions are supported on a low-dimensional manifold. We prove statistical guarantees of generative networks under the Wasserstein-1 loss. We show that the Wasserstein-1 loss converges to zero at a fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension instead of the ambient data dimension. Our theory leverages the low-dimensional geometric structures in data sets and justifies the practical power of generative networks. We require no smoothness assumptions on the data distribution which is desirable in practice."}}

Most existing function approximation theories suggest that with sufficiently many parameters, neural networks can well approximate certain classes of functions in terms of the function value. The neural network themselves, however, can be highly nonsmooth. To bridge this gap, we take convolutional residual networks (ConvResNets) as an example, and prove that large ConvResNets can not only approximate a target function in terms of function value, but also exhibit sufficient first-order smoothness. Moreover, we extend our theory to approximating functions supported on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory partially justifies the benefits of using deep and wide networks in practice. Numerical experiments on adversarial robust image classification are provided to support our theory."}}

Even for the most data-efficient MLFF models, reaching chemical accuracy can require hundreds of frames of force and energy labels generated by expensive quantum mechanical algorithms, which may scale as $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^7)$, with $n$ being the number of basis functions used and typically proportional to the number of atoms.\nTo address this issue, we propose a multi-stage computational framework -- ASTEROID, which enjoys low training data generation cost without significantly sacrificing MLFFs' accuracy. Specifically, ASTEROID leverages a combination of both large cheap inaccurate data and small expensive accurate data. The motivation behind ASTEROID is that inaccurate data, though incurring large bias, can help capture the sophisticated structures of the underlying force field. Therefore, we first train a MLFF model on a large amount of inaccurate training data, employing a bias-aware loss function to prevent the model from overfitting the potential bias of the inaccurate training data. We then fine-tune the obtained model using a small amount of accurate training data, which preserves the knowledge learned from the inaccurate training data while significantly improving the model's accuracy. Moreover, we propose a variant of ASTEROID based on score matching for the setting where the inaccurate training data are unlabelled. Extensive experiments on MD simulation datasets show that ASTEROID can significantly reduce data generation costs while improving the accuracy of MLFFs."}}

The student distills knowledge from the teacher by mimicking the hidden representations of the teacher at every intermediate layer. However, layer-wise distillation is difficult. Since the student has a smaller model capacity than the teacher, it is often under-fitted. Furthermore, the hidden representations of the teacher contain redundant information that the student does not necessarily need for the target task's learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Task-aware layEr-wise Distillation (TED). TED designs task-aware filters to align the hidden representations of the student and the teacher at each layer. The filters select the knowledge that is useful for the target task from the hidden representations. As such, TED reduces the knowledge gap between the two models and helps the student to fit better on the target task. We evaluate TED in two scenarios: continual pre-training and fine-tuning. TED demonstrates significant and consistent improvements over existing distillation methods in both scenarios. We will make our code publicly available."}}

This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a compact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with small computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that match the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a large prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge distillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target width is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing baselines. Our codes will be released."}}

Specifically, a GNN is first pre-trained on a large-scale unlabeled graph and then fine-tuned on a separate small labeled graph for downstream applications, such as node classification. One popular pre-training method is to mask out a proportion of the edges, and a GNN is trained to recover them. However, such a generative method suffers from graph mismatch. That is, the masked graph input to the GNN deviates from the original graph. To alleviate this issue, we propose DiP-GNN (Discriminative Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks). Specifically, we train a generator to recover identities of the masked edges, and simultaneously, we train a discriminator to distinguish the generated edges from the original graph's edges. The discriminator is subsequently used for downstream fine-tuning. In our pre-training framework, the graph seen by the discriminator better matches the original graph because the generator can recover a proportion of the masked edges. Extensive experiments on large-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our code will be publicly available."}}

However, common practice fine-tunes all of the parameters in a pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive when a large number of downstream tasks are present. Therefore, many fine-tuning methods are proposed to learn incremental updates of pre-trained weights in a parameter efficient way, e.g., low-rank increments. These methods often evenly distribute the budget of incremental updates across all pre-trained weight matrices, and overlook the varying importance of different weight parameters. As a consequence, the fine-tuning performance is suboptimal. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaLoRA, which adaptively allocates the parameter budget among weight matrices according to their importance score. In particular, AdaLoRA parameterizes the incremental updates in the form of singular value decomposition. Such a novel approach allows us to effectively prune the singular values of unimportant updates, which is essentially to reduce their parameter budget but circumvent intensive exact SVD computations. We conduct extensive experiments with several pre-trained models on natural language processing, question answering, and natural language generation to validate the effectiveness of AdaLoRA. Results demonstrate that AdaLoRA manifests notable improvement over baselines, especially in the low budget settings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QingruZhang/AdaLoRA ."}}

We show that, by choosing network size appropriately, one can leverage any low-dimensional manifold structure in the Markov decision process and obtain a sample-efficient estimator without suffering from the curse of high data ambient dimensionality. Specifically, we establish a sharp error bound for fitted Q-evaluation, which depends on the intrinsic dimension of the state-action space, the smoothness of Bellman operator, and a function class-restricted $\\chi^2$-divergence. It is noteworthy that the restricted $\\chi^2$-divergence measures the behavior and target policies' {\\it mismatch in the function space}, which can be small even if the two policies are not close to each other in their tabular forms.

To address such a challenge of scale, we identify a class of cooperative MARL problems with permutation invariance, and formulate it as mean-field Markov decision processes (MDP). To exploit the permutation invariance therein, we propose the mean-field proximal policy optimization (MF-PPO) algorithm, at the core of which is a permutation- invariant actor-critic neural architecture. We prove that MF-PPO attains the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate of convergence. Moreover, its sample complexity is independent of the number of agents. We validate the theoretical advantages of MF-PPO with numerical experiments in the multi-agent particle environment (MPE). In particular, we show that the inductive bias introduced by the permutation-invariant neural architecture enables MF-PPO to outperform existing competitors with a smaller number of model parameters, which is the key to its generalization performance.\n"}}
