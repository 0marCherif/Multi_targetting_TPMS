However, we find these two paradigms have different characteristics: (i) contrastive models are data-hungry that suffer from a representation over-fitting issue; (ii) generative models have a data filling issue that shows inferior data scaling capacity compared to contrastive models. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of both paradigms, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose Contrast with Reconstruct (ReCon) that unifies these two paradigms. ReCon is trained to learn from both generative modeling teachers and single/cross-modal contrastive teachers through ensemble distillation, where the generative student guides the contrastive student. An encoder-decoder style ReCon-block is proposed that transfers knowledge through cross attention with stop-gradient, which avoids pretraining over-fitting and pattern difference issues. ReCon achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, e.g., 91.26% accuracy on ScanObjectNN. Codes have been released at https://github.com/qizekun/ReCon."}}

This promotes the potential of utilizing models pretrained with data more than 3D as teachers for cross-modal knowledge transferring. In this paper, we revisit masked modeling in a unified fashion of knowledge distillation, and we show that foundational Transformers pretrained with 2D images or natural languages can help self-supervised 3D representation learning through training Autoencoders as Cross-Modal Teachers (ACT). The pretrained Transformers are transferred as cross-modal 3D teachers using discrete variational autoencoding self-supervision, during which the Transformers are frozen with prompt tuning for better knowledge inheritance. The latent features encoded by the 3D teachers are used as the target of masked point modeling, wherein the dark knowledge is distilled to the 3D Transformer students as foundational geometry understanding. Our ACT pretrained 3D learner achieves state-of-the-art generalization capacity across various downstream benchmarks, e.g., 88.21% overall accuracy on ScanObjectNN.
