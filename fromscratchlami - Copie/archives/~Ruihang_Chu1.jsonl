To leverage the unlabeled data to boost model performance, we present a novel Two-Way Inter-label Self-Training framework named TWIST. It exploits inherent correlations between semantic understanding and instance information of a scene. Specifically, we consider two kinds of pseudo labels for semantic-and instance-level supervision. Our key design is to provide object-level information for denoising pseudo labels and make use of their correlation for two-way mutual enhancement, thereby iteratively promoting the pseudo-label qualities. TWIST attains leading performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS, compared to recent 3D pre-training approaches, and can cooperate with them to further enhance performance, eg,+ 4.4% AP50 on 1%-label ScanNet data-efficient benchmark.

This game is really complicated to play due to the long game timeline, various society/buildings/units, a large number of actions or selections, different constraints (e.g., population limit), and the partially observed environments. In this project, we plan to develop a reinforcement learning model for the beginning of Starcraft II game, instead of the full-length game. The beginning of the game is essential for the further economy, population increase, and technology development. Our project is based on the SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment) platform. We build a feasible pipeline for training reinforcement learning models and design random, scripted, and our actor-critic based agents. Experiments show that our actor-critic based agents can learn valuable knowledge in this task.
