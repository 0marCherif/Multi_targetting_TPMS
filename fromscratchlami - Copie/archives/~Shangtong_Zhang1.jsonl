However, little is know about how fast SARSA converges to that region and how large the region is. In this paper, we make progress towards solving this open problem by showing the convergence rate of projected SARSA to a bounded region. Importantly, the region is much smaller than the ball used for projection provided that the the magnitude of the reward is not too large. Our analysis applies to expected SARSA as well as SARSA($\\lambda$). Existing works regarding the convergence of linear SARSA to a fixed point all require the Lipschitz constant of SARSA's policy improvement operator to be sufficiently small; our analysis instead applies to arbitrary Lipschitz constants and thus characterizes the behavior of linear SARSA for a new regime."}}

It also has an active human competitive scene. StarCraft II is uniquely suited for advancing offline RL algorithms, both because of its challenging nature and because a massive dataset of millions of StarCraft II games played by human players has been released by Blizzard. This paper leverages that and establishes a benchmark, which we call StarCraft II Unplugged, that introduces unprecedented challenges for offline reinforcement learning. We define a dataset (a subset of Blizzard\u2019s release), tools standardising an API for ML methods, and an evaluation protocol. We also present baseline agents, including behaviour cloning, and offline variants of V-trace actor-critic and MuZero. We find that the variants of those algorithms with behaviour value estimation and single step policy improvement work best and exceed 90% win rate against previously published AlphaStar behaviour cloning agents."}}

MVPI enjoys great flexibility in that any policy evaluation method and risk-neutral control method can be dropped in for risk-averse control off the shelf, in both on- and off-policy settings. This flexibility reduces the gap between risk-neutral control and risk-averse control and is achieved by working on a novel augmented MDP directly. We propose risk-averse TD3 as an example instantiating MVPI, which outperforms vanilla TD3 and many previous risk-averse control methods in challenging Mujoco robot simulation tasks under a risk-aware performance metric. This risk-averse TD3 is the first to introduce deterministic policies and off-policy learning into risk-averse reinforcement learning, both of which are key to the performance boost we show in Mujoco domains."}}

Despite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the notorious deadly triad of off-policy RL, there are still two open problems. First, followon traces typically suffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Second, though Yu (2015) confirms the asymptotic convergence of some emphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample analysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this paper, we address those two open problems simultaneously via using truncated followon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces, which depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only finite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of our proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control."}}

When combined with function approximation, such as neural networks, this combination is known as the deadly triad and is potentially unstable. Recently, it has been shown that stability and good performance at scale can be achieved by combining emphatic weightings and multi-step updates. This approach, however, is generally limited to sampling complete trajectories in order, to compute the required emphatic weighting. In this paper we investigate how to combine emphatic weightings with non-sequential, off-line data sampled from a replay buffer. We develop a multi-step emphatic weighting that can be combined with replay, and a time-reversed $n$-step TD learning algorithm to learn the required emphatic weighting. We show that these state weightings reduce variance compared with prior approaches, while providing convergence guarantees. We tested the approach at scale on Atari 2600 video games, and observed that the new X-ETD($n$) agent improved over baseline agents, highlighting both the scalability and broad applicability of our approach."}}

In this paper, we investigate the target network as a tool for breaking the deadly triad, providing theoretical support for the conventional wisdom that a target network stabilizes training. We first propose and analyze a novel target network update rule which augments the commonly used Polyak-averaging style update with two projections. We then apply the target network and ridge regularization in several divergent algorithms and show their convergence to regularized TD fixed points. Those algorithms are off-policy with linear function approximation and bootstrapping, spanning both policy evaluation and control, as well as both discounted and average-reward settings. In particular, we provide the first convergent linear $Q$-learning algorithms under nonrestrictive and changing behavior policies without bi-level optimization."}}

Our work goes beyond existing works on the optimality of policy gradient methods in that existing works use the exact policy gradient for updating the policy parameters while we use an approximate and stochastic update step. Our update step is not a gradient update because we do not use a density ratio to correct the state distribution, which aligns well with what practitioners do. Our update is approximate because we use a learned critic instead of the true value function. Our update is stochastic because at each step the update is done for only the current state action pair. Moreover, we remove several restrictive assumptions from existing works in our analysis. Central to our work is the finite sample analysis of a generic stochastic approximation algorithm with time-inhomogeneous update operators on time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, based on its uniform contraction properties."}}
