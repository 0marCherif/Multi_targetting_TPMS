Unfortunately, how best to incorporate historical data is unclear: naively initializing reward estimates using all historical samples can suffer from spurious data and imbalanced data coverage, leading to computational and storage issues - particularly in continuous action spaces. We address these two challenges by proposing Artificial Replay, a meta-algorithm for incorporating historical data into any arbitrary base bandit algorithm. Artificial Replayuses only a subset of the historical data as needed to reduce computation and storage. We show that for a broad class of base algorithms that satisfy independence of irrelevant data (IIData), a novel property that we introduce, our method achieves equal regret as a full warm-start approach while potentially using only a fraction of historical data. We complement these theoretical results with a case study of $K$-armed and continuous combinatorial bandit algorithms, including on a green security domain using real poaching data, to show the practical benefits of Artificial Replayin achieving optimal regret alongside low computational and storage costs."}}

A standard notion of `fairness' in this setting is that an allocation simultaneously satisfy envy-freeness and efficiency.

We complement this uncertainty principle with a simple algorithm, HopeGuardrail, which allocates resources based on an adaptive threshold policy. We show that our algorithm is able to achieve any fairness-efficiency point on this frontier, and moreover, in simulation results, provides allocations close to the optimal fair solution in hindsight. This motivates its use in practical applications, as the algorithm is able to adapt to any desired fairness efficiency trade-off. "}}

Two major questions in designing discretization-based algorithms are how to create the discretization and when to refine it. While there have been several experimental results investigating heuristic solutions to these questions, there has been little theoretical treatment. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of tree-based hierarchical partitioning methods for online reinforcement learning, providing model-free and model-based algorithms. We show how our algorithms are able to take advantage of inherent structure of the problem by providing guarantees that scale with respect to the 'zooming dimension' instead of the ambient dimension, an instance-dependent quantity measuring the benignness of the optimal $Q_h^\\star$ function. Many applications in computing systems and operations research requires algorithms that compete on three facets: low sample complexity, mild storage requirements, and low computational burden. Our algorithms are easily adapted to operating constraints, and our theory provides explicit bounds across each of the three facets. This motivates its use in practical applications as our approach automatically adapts to underlying problem structure even when very little is known a priori about the system."}}

Our goal is to find a fair allocation - one that is simultaneously Pareto-efficient and envy-free. When all utilities are known upfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable (and efficiently computable) for a large class of utility functions. In a sequential setting, however, no policy can guarantee these desiderata simultaneously for all possible utility realizations. A natural online fair allocation objective is to minimize the deviation of each agent's final allocation from their fair allocation in hindsight. This translates into simultaneous guarantees for both Pareto-efficiency and envy-freeness. However, the resulting dynamic program has state-space which is exponential in the number of agents. We propose a simple policy, HopeOnline, that instead aims to `match' the ex-post fair allocation vector using the current available resources and `predicted' histogram of future utilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy compared to other heurstics on a dataset inspired by mobile food-bank allocations."}}
