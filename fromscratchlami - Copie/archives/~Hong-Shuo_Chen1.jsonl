GS consists of three modules: 1) pixel-based anomaly prediction, 2) embedding location detection, and 3) decision fusion for image-level detection. In the first module, GS decomposes an image into patches, adopts Saab transforms for feature extraction, and conducts self-supervised learning to predict an anomaly score of their center pixel. In the second module, GS analyzes the anomaly scores of a pixel and its neighborhood to find pixels of higher embedding probabilities. In the third module, GS focuses on pixels of higher embedding probabilities and fuses their anomaly scores to make final image-level classification. Compared with state-of-the-art deep-learning models, GS achieves comparable detection performance against S-UNIWARD, WOW and HILL steganography schemes with significantly lower computational complexity and a smaller model size, making it attractive for mobile/edge applications. Furthermore, GS is mathematically transparent because of its modular design."}}

The DefakeHop method was developed previously for detection of deepfake generated faces under the successive subspace learning (SSL) framework. PSL is proposed to extract features from responses of multiple single-stage filter banks (or called PixelHops), which operate in parallel, and it improves SSL that extracts features from multi-stage cascaded filter banks. PSL has two advantages. First, PSL preserves discriminant features often lie in high-frequency channels, which are however ignored by SSL. Second, decisions from multiple filter banks can be ensembled to further improve detection accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSL-DefakeHop method, we evaluate it on the UW Fake Satellite Image dataset and observe perfect classification performance (i.e., 100% F1 score, precision and recall)."}}

A-PixelHop is designed under the assumption that it is difficult to synthesize high-quality, high-frequency components in local regions. It contains four building modules: 1) selecting edge/texture blocks that contain significant high-frequency components, 2) applying multiple filter banks to them to obtain rich sets of spatial-spectral responses as features, 3) feeding features to multiple binary classifiers to obtain a set of soft decisions, 4) developing an effective ensemble scheme to fuse the soft decisions into the final decision.

The improvements lie in two areas. First, DefakeHop examines three facial regions (i.e., two eyes and mouth) while DefakeHop++ includes eight more landmarks for broader coverage. Second, for discriminant features selection, DefakeHop uses an unsupervised approach while DefakeHop++ adopts a more effective approach with supervision, called the Discriminant Feature Test (DFT). In DefakeHop++, rich spatial and spectral features are first derived from facial regions and landmarks automatically. Then, DFT is used to select a subset of discriminant features for classifier training. As compared with MobileNet v3 (a lightweight CNN model of 1.5M parameters targeting at mobile applications), DefakeHop++ has a model of 238K parameters, which is 16% of MobileNet v3. Furthermore, DefakeHop++ outperforms MobileNet v3 in Deepfake image detection performance in a weakly-supervised setting."}}

The major drawback of existing dynamic texture synthesis models comes from poor treatment of the long-range texture correlation and motion information. To address this problem, we incorporate a new loss term, called the Shifted Gram loss, to capture the structural and long-range correlation of the reference texture video. Furthermore, we introduce a frame sampling strategy to exploit long-period motion across multiple frames. With these two new techniques, the application scope of existing texture synthesis models can be extended. That is, they can synthesize not only homogeneous but also structured dynamic texture patterns. Thorough experimental results are provided to demonstrate that our proposed dynamic texture synthesis model offers state-of-the-art visual performance."}}
