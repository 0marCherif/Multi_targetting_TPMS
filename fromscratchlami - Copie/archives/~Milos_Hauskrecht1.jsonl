However, information-seeking behavior varies across EMR users. To explicitly account for this variability, we derived hierarchical models and compared their performance to nonhierarchical models in identifying relevant patient information in intensive care unit (ICU) cases.\n\nMaterials and methods\nCritical care physicians reviewed ICU patient cases and selected data items relevant for presenting at morning rounds. Using patient EMR data as predictors, we derived hierarchical logistic regression (HLR) and standard logistic regression (LR) models to predict their relevance.\n\nResults\nIn 73 pairs of HLR and LR models, the HLR models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.80\u20130.82], which was statistically significantly higher than that of LR models (0.75, 95% CI [0.74\u20130.76]). Further, the HLR models achieved statistically significantly lower expected calibration error (0.07, 95% CI [0.06\u20130.08]) than LR models (0.16, 95% CI [0.14\u20130.17]).\n\nDiscussion\nThe physician reviewers demonstrated variability in selecting relevant data. Our results show that HLR models perform significantly better than LR models with respect to both discrimination and calibration. This is likely due to explicitly modeling physician-related variability.\n\nConclusion\nHierarchical models can yield better performance when there is physician-related variability as in the case of identifying relevant information in the EMR."}}

For learning a kernel over a large number of objects, existing methods face significant scalability issues inhibiting the application of these methods to settings where a kernel is learned in an online and timely fashion. In this paper we propose a novel framework called Efficient online Relative comparison Kernel LEarning (ERKLE), for efficiently learning the similarity of a large set of objects in an online manner. We learn a kernel from rela- tive comparisons via stochastic gradient descent, one query response at a time, by taking advantage of the sparse and low-rank properties of the gradient to efficiently restrict the kernel to lie in the space of positive semidefinite matrices. In addition, we derive a passive-aggressive online update for minimally satisfying new relative comparisons as to not disrupt the influence of previously obtained comparisons. Ex- perimentally, we demonstrate a considerable improvement in speed while obtaining improved or comparable accuracy compared to current methods in the online learning setting."}}

We propose a new machine learning framework that learns multi-class classification models from ordered class sets the annotator may use to express not only her top class choice but also other competing classes still under consideration. Such ordered sets of competing classes are common, for example, in various diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we first develop strategies for learning multi-class classification models from examples associated with ordered class set information. After that we develop an active learning strategy that considers such a feedback. We evaluate the benefit of the framework on multiple datasets. We show that class-order feedback and active learning can reduce the annotation cost both individually and jointly."}}

Such time series are referred to as hierarchical time series (HTS) and they are very common in business, management, energy consumption, social networks, or web traffic modeling and analysis. We propose a new flexible hierarchical forecasting framework, that takes advantage of the hierarchical relational structure to predict individual time series. Our new forecasting framework is able to (1) handle HTS modeling and forecasting problems; (2) make accurate forecasting for HTS with seasonal patterns; (3) incorporate various individual forecasting models and combine heuristics based on the HTS datasets' own characterization. The proposed framework is evaluated on a real-world web traffic data set. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior when applied to hierarchical web traffic prediction problems, and it outperforms alternative time series prediction models in terms of accuracy"}}

As this process can be very time consuming and costly, finding effective ways to reduce the annotation cost becomes critical for building such models. In this work we solve this problem by exploring a new approach that actively learns classification models from groups, which are subpopulations of instances, and human feedback on the groups. Each group is labeled with a number in [0,1] interval representing a human estimate of the proportion of instances with one of the class labels in this subpopulation. To form the groups to be annotated, we develop a hierarchical active learning framework that divides the whole population into smaller subpopulations, which allows us to gradually learn more refined models from the subpopulations and their class proportion labels. Our extensive experiments on numerous datasets show that our method is competitive and outperforms existing approaches for reducing the human annotation cost."}}

A challenging aspect of this process is that the model should be flexible and adaptive to reflect well patient-specific temporal behaviors and this also in the case when the available patient-specific data are sparse and short span. To address this problem we propose and develop an adaptive two-stage forecasting approach for modeling multivariate, irregularly sampled clinical time series of varying lengths. The proposed model (1) learns the population trend from a collection of time series for past patients; (2) captures individual-specific short-term multivariate variability; and (3) adapts by automatically adjusting its predictions based on new observations. The proposed forecasting model is evaluated on a real-world clinical time series dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior on the prediction tasks for multivariate, irregularly sampled clinical time series, and it outperforms both the population based and patient-specific time series prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy."}}

However, in general, it is difficult to set the dimension of an LDS's hidden state space. A small number of hidden states may not be able to model the complexities of a MTS, while a large number of hidden states can lead to overfitting. In this paper, we study learning methods that impose various regularization penalties on the transition matrix of the LDS model and propose a regularized LDS learning framework (rLDS) which aims to (1) automatically shut down LDSs' spurious and unnecessary dimensions, and consequently, address the problem of choosing the optimal number of hidden states; (2) prevent the overfitting problem given a small amount of MTS data; and (3) support accurate MTS forecasting. To learn the regularized LDS from data we incorporate a second order cone program and a generalized gradient descent method into the Maximum a Posteriori framework and use Expectation Maximization to obtain a low-rank transition matrix of the LDS model. We propose two priors for modeling the matrix which lead to two instances of our rLDS. We show that our rLDS is able to recover well the intrinsic dimensionality of the time series dynamics and it improves the predictive performance when compared to baselines on both synthetic and real-world MTS datasets."}}
