Unlike traditional rumors or fake news editors who mainly rely on generated and/or counterfeited images, text and videos, current misinformation creators now more tend to use out-of-context multimedia contents (e.g. mismatched images and captions) to deceive the public and fake news detection systems. This new type of misinformation increases the difficulty of not only detection but also clarification, because every individual modality is close enough to true information. To address this challenge, in this paper we explore how to achieve interpretable cross-modal de-contextualization detection that simultaneously identifies the mismatched pairs and the cross-modal contradictions, which is helpful for fact-check websites to document clarifications. The proposed model first symbolically disassembles the text-modality information to a set of fact queries based on the Abstract Meaning Representation of the caption and then forwards the query-image pairs into a pre-trained large vision-language model select the ``evidences\" that are helpful for us to detect misinformation. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed methodology can provide us with much more interpretable predictions while maintaining the accuracy same as the state-of-the-art model on this task."}}

Though BP has been applied successfully to many different fields, it offers no performance guarantee and often performs poorly on loopy graphs. To improve the performance on loopy graphs and to scale up to large graphs, we propose a variational message passing neural network (V-MPNN), where we leverage both the power of neural networks in modeling complex functions and the well-established algorithmic theories on variational belief propagation. Instead of relying on a hand-crafted variational assumption, we propose a neural free energy where a general variational distribution is parameterized through a neural network. A message passing neural network is utilized for the minimization of neural free energy. Training of the MPNN is thus guided by neural free energy, without requiring exact MAP configurations as annotations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed V-MPNN by comparing against both state-of-the-art training-free methods and training-based methods."}}

Image-based 3D face reconstruction, which can represent a dense space of facial motions, is typically accomplished by estimating identity, expression, texture, head pose, and illumination separately via pre-constructed 3D morphable models (3DMMs). Recent 3D reconstruction models can recover high-quality geometric facial details like wrinkles and pores, but are still limited in their ability to recover 3D subtle motions caused by the activation of AUs. We present a multi-stage learning framework that recovers AU-interpretable 3D facial details by learning personalized AU-specific blendshapes from images. Our model explicitly learns 3D expression basis by using AU labels and generic AU relationship prior and then constrains the basis coefficients such that they are semantically mapped to each AU. Our AU-aware 3D reconstruction model generates accurate 3D expressions composed by semantically meaningful AU motion components. Furthermore, the output of the model can be directly applied to generate 3D AU occurrence predictions, which have not been fully explored by prior 3D reconstruction models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via qualitative and quantitative evaluations."}}

Various prior knowledge often exists in the target domain and their use can alleviate the deficiencies with deep learning. To better mimic the behavior of human brains, different advanced methods have been proposed to identify domain knowledge and integrate it into deep models for data-efficient, generalizable, and interpretable deep learning, which we refer to as knowledge-augmented deep learning (KADL). In this survey, we define the concept of KADL, and introduce its three major tasks, i.e., knowledge identification, knowledge representation, and knowledge integration. Different from existing surveys that are focused on a specific type of knowledge, we provide a broad and complete taxonomy of domain knowledge and its representations. Based on our taxonomy, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, different from existing works that survey integration approaches agnostic to taxonomy of knowledge. This survey subsumes existing works and offers a bird's-eye view of research in the general area of knowledge-augmented deep learning. The thorough and critical reviews of numerous papers help not only understand current progresses but also identify future directions for the research on knowledge-augmented deep learning."}}

However, most of message passing algorithms focus on one structure and the messages are estimated by one single approach. For the real-world data, like facial action units (AUs), the dependencies may vary in terms of different expressions and individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid message passing neural network with performance-driven structures (HMP-PS), which combines complementary message passing methods and captures more possible structures in a Bayesian manner. Particularly, a performance-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method is proposed for generating high performance graph structures. Besides, the hybrid message passing is proposed to combine different types of messages, which provide the complementary information. The contribution of each type of message is adaptively adjusted along with different inputs. The experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., BP4D and DISFA, validate that our proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance."}}

Knowledge graph completion (also known as relation prediction) is the task of inferring missing facts given existing ones. Most of the existing work is proposed by maximizing the likelihood of observed instance-level triples. Not much attention, however, is paid to the ontological information, such as type information of entities and relations. In this work, we propose a type-augmented relation prediction (TaRP) method, where we apply both the type information and instance-level information for the relation prediction. In particular, type information and instance-level information are encoded as prior probabilities and likelihoods of relations respectively, and are combined by following the Bayes' rule. Our proposed TaRP method achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets: FB15K, FB15K-237, YAGO26K-906, and DB111K-174. In addition, we show that the TaRP achieves the significantly improved data efficiency. More importantly, the type information extracted from a specific dataset can generalize well to different datasets through the proposed TaRP model."}}

First, we propose to use Bayesian Network to capture the inherent dependencies among the AUs. Second, we introduce probabilistic graph convolution that allows to perform graph convolution on the distribution of Bayesian Network structure to extract AU structural features. Finally, we introduce a dynamic deep model based on LSTM to simultaneously combine AU appearance features, AU dynamic features, and AU structural features for improved AU intensity estimation. In experiments, our method achieves comparable and even better performance with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark facial AU intensity estimation databases, i.e., FERA 2015 and DISFA."}}
