Implicit neural representations (INRs) have become popular for this task, but when information relating to the inside versus outside of a shape is not available (such as shape occupancy, signed distances or surface normal orientation) optimization relies on heuristics and regularizers to recover the surface. These methods can be slow to converge and easily get stuck in local minima. \n    We propose a two-step approach, OG-INR, where we (1) construct a discrete octree and label what is inside and outside (2) optimize for a continuous and high-fidelity shape using an INR that is initially guided by the octree's labelling. To solve for our labelling, we propose an energy function over the discrete structure and provide an efficient move-making algorithm that explores many possible labellings. Furthermore we show that we can easily inject knowledge into the discrete octree, providing a simple way to influence the result from the continuous INR.\n    We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two unoriented surface reconstruction datasets and show competitive performance compared to other unoriented, and some oriented, methods. Our results show that the exploration by the move-making algorithm avoids many of the bad local minima reached by purely gradient descent optimized methods (see Figure 1)."}}

These differentiability results can lead to significant memory savings by providing an expression for computing the derivative without needing to unroll the steps of the forward-pass optimization procedure during the backward pass. However, the results typically require inverting a large Hessian matrix, which is computationally expensive when implemented naively. In this work we study two applications of deep declarative networks -- robust vector pooling and optimal transport -- and show how problem structure can be exploited to obtain very efficient backward pass computations in terms of both time and memory. Our ideas can be used as a guide for improving the computational performance of other novel deep declarative nodes."}}

Existing INRs require point coordinates to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. When a normal vector is available for each point, a higher fidelity representation can be learned, however normal vectors are often not provided as raw data. Furthermore, the method's initialization has been shown to play a crucial role for surface reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for sinusoidal INRs that further improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of surface reconstruction and shape space learning and show SOTA performance compared to other unoriented methods.

For typical models this is non-trivial as only the conditional distribution of each symbol given the earlier symbols is available, while the constraints correspond to arbitrary times. Previously this has been addressed by assuming a discrete time model of fixed rhythm. We generalise to continuous time and arbitrary rhythm by introducing a simple, novel, and efficient particle filter scheme, applicable to general continuous time point processes. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that in comparison with a more traditional beam search baseline, the particle filter exhibits superior statistical properties and yields more agreeable results in an extensive human listening test experiment."}}
