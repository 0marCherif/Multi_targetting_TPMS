The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0-th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each specific class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3.6%, 4.4%, and 1.9% in the 25-Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively."}}

However, these models lack explicit control over the 3D structure in the generated images. Consequently, this hinders our ability to obtain detailed 3D annotations for the generated images or to craft instances with specific poses and distances. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that incorporates 3D geometry control into diffusion models. Our method exploits ControlNet, which extends diffusion models by using visual prompts in addition to text prompts. We generate images of the 3D objects taken from 3D shape repositories (e.g., ShapeNet and Objaverse), render them from a variety of poses and viewing directions, compute the edge maps of the rendered images, and use these edge maps as visual prompts to generate realistic images. With explicit 3D geometry control, we can easily change the 3D structures of the objects in the generated images and obtain ground-truth 3D annotations automatically. This allows us to improve a wide range of vision tasks, e.g., classification and 3D pose estimation, in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on ImageNet-100, ImageNet-R, PASCAL3D+, ObjectNet3D, and OOD-CV. The results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.8 percentage points on ImageNet-100 using DeiT-B and 3.5 percentage points on PASCAL3D+ & ObjectNet3D using NeMo."}}

A common technique to address this is knowledge distillation (KD), which penalizes prediction inconsistencies between old and new models. Such prediction is made with almost new class data, as old class data is extremely scarce due to the strict memory limitation in CIL. In this paper, we take a deep dive into KD losses and find that \"using new class data for KD\" not only hinders the model adaption (for learning new classes) but also results in low efficiency for preserving old class knowledge. We address this by \"using the placebos of old classes for KD\", where the placebos are chosen from a free image stream, such as Google Images, in an automatical and economical fashion. To this end, we train an online placebo selection policy to quickly evaluate the quality of streaming images (good or bad placebos) and use only good ones for one-time feed-forward computation of KD. We formulate the policy training process as an online Markov Decision Process (MDP), and introduce an online learning algorithm to solve this MDP problem without causing much computation costs. In experiments, we show that our method 1) is surprisingly effective even when there is no class overlap between placebos and original old class data, 2) does not require any additional supervision or memory budget, and 3) significantly outperforms a number of top-performing CIL methods, in particular when using lower memory budgets for old class exemplars, e.g., five exemplars per class."}}

As other incremental settings, IOD is subject to catastrophic forgetting, which is often addressed by techniques such as knowledge distillation (KD) and exemplar replay (ER). However, KD and ER do not work well if applied directly to state-of-the-art transformer-based object detectors such as Deformable DETR and UP-DETR. In this paper, we solve these issues by proposing a ContinuaL DEtection TRansformer (CL-DETR), a new method for transformer-based IOD which enables effective usage of KD and ER in this context. First, we introduce a Detector Knowledge Distillation (DKD) loss, focusing on the most informative and reliable predictions from old versions of the model, ignoring redundant background predictions, and ensuring compatibility with the available ground-truth labels. We also improve ER by proposing a calibration strategy to preserve the label distribution of the training set, therefore better matching training and testing statistics. We conduct extensive experiments on COCO 2017 and demonstrate that CL-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results in the IOD setting."}}

Although impressive advances have been made, AI algorithms still suffer from an important limitation: they rely on large-scale datasets. In contrast, human beings naturally possess the ability to learn novel knowledge from real-world and imperfect data such as a small number of samples or a non-static continual data stream. Attaining such an ability is particularly appealing. Specifically, an ideal AI system with human-level intelligence should work with the following imperfect data scenarios. 1)~The training data distribution changes while learning. In many real scenarios, data are streaming, might disappear after a given period of time, or even can not be stored at all due to storage constraints or privacy issues. As a consequence, the old knowledge is over-written, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting. 2)~The annotations of the training data are sparse. There are also many scenarios where we do not have access to the specific large-scale data of interest due to privacy and security reasons. As a consequence, the deep models overfit the training data distribution and are very likely to make wrong decisions when they encounter rare cases. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to tackle the challenges and develop AI algorithms that can be trained with imperfect data. To achieve the above goal, we study three topics in this thesis. 1)~Learning with continual data without forgetting (i.e., incremental learning). 2)~Learning with limited data without overfitting (i.e., few-shot learning). 3)~Learning with imperfect data in real-world applications (e.g., incremental object detection). Our key idea is learning to learn/optimize. Specifically, we use advanced learning and optimization techniques to design data-driven methods to dynamically adapt the key elements in AI algorithms, e.g., selection of data, memory allocation, network architecture, essential hyperparameters, and control of knowledge transfer. We believe that the adaptive and dynamic design of system elements will significantly improve the capability of deep learning systems under limited data or continual streams, compared to the systems with fixed and non-optimized elements. More specifically, we first study how to overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem by learning to optimize exemplar data, allocate memory, aggregate neural networks, and optimize key hyperparameters. Then, we study how to improve the generalization ability of the model and tackle the overfitting problem by learning to transfer knowledge and ensemble deep models. Finally, we study how to apply incremental learning techniques to the recent top-performance transformer-based architecture for a more challenging and realistic vision, incremental object detection."}}

In this paper, we break this \"few-shot\" limit based on a simple yet surprisingly effective idea: compressing exemplars by downsampling non-discriminative pixels and saving \"many-shot\" compressed exemplars in the memory. Without needing any manual annotation, we achieve this compression by generating 0-1 masks on discriminative pixels from class activation maps (CAM). We propose an adaptive mask generation model called class-incremental masking (CIM) to explicitly resolve two difficulties of using CAM: 1) transforming the heatmaps of CAM to 0-1 masks with an arbitrary threshold leads to a trade-off between the coverage on discriminative pixels and the quantity of exemplars, as the total memory is fixed; and 2) optimal thresholds vary for different object classes, which is particularly obvious in the dynamic environment of CIL. We optimize the CIM model alternatively with the conventional CIL model through a bilevel optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on high-resolution CIL benchmarks including Food-101, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1000, and show that using the compressed exemplars by CIM can achieve a new state-of-the-art CIL accuracy, e.g., 4.8 percentage points higher than FOSTER on 10-Phase ImageNet-1000.
