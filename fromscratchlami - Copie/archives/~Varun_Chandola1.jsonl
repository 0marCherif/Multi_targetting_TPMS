However, in classification models, most data features are often similar which can lead to increase in training time without significant improvement in the performance. Thus, we hypothesize that there could be a more efficient way to train an ANN using a better representative sample. For this, we propose the LAD Improved Iterative Training (LIIT), a novel training approach for ANN using large deviations principle to generate and iteratively update training samples in a fast and efficient setting. This is exploratory work with extensive opportunities for future work. The thesis presents this ongoing research work with the following contributions from this study: (1) We propose a novel ANN training method, LIIT, based on the large deviations theory where additional dimensionality reduction is not needed to study high dimensional data. (2) The LIIT approach uses a Modified Training Sample (MTS) that is generated and iteratively updated using a LAD anomaly score based sampling strategy. (3) The MTS sample is designed to be well representative of the training data by including most anomalous of the observations in each class. This ensures distinct patterns and features are learnt with smaller samples. (4) We study the classification performance of the LIIT trained ANNs with traditional batch trained counterparts."}}

Instead, given the difference in scales at which the two sub-systems evolve, the two sub-systems are typically (re)solved separately. Popular approaches such as the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) use a two-step strategy where the governing reaction kinetics are pre-computed and mapped to a low-dimensional manifold, characterized by a few reaction progress variables (model reduction) and the manifold is then ``looked-up'' during the runtime to estimate the high-dimensional system state by the flow system. While existing works have focused on these two steps independently, in this work we show that joint learning of the progress variables and the look--up model, can yield more accurate results. We build on the base formulation and implementation ChemTab to include the dynamically generated Themochemical State Variables (Lower Dimensional Dynamic Source Terms). We discuss the challenges in the implementation of this deep neural network architecture and experimentally demonstrate it's superior performance."}}

However, identifying extreme trends relative to a collection of other time series is of significant interest, like in the fields of public health policy, social justice and pandemic propagation. We propose an algorithm that can scale to large collections of time series data using the concepts from the theory of large deviations. Exploiting the ability of the algorithm to scale to high-dimensional data, we propose an online anomaly detection method to identify anomalies in a collection of multivariate time series. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed Large Deviations Anomaly Detection (LAD) algorithm in identifying counties in the United States with anomalous trends in terms of COVID-19 related cases and deaths. Several of the identified anomalous counties correlate with counties with documented poor response to the COVID pandemic."}}

In our previous work, we showed that using a deep architecture to learn the two steps jointly, instead of separately, is 73% more accurate at estimating the source energy, a key state variable, compared to benchmarks and can be integrated within a DNS turbulent combustion framework. In their natural form, such deep architectures do not allow for uncertainty quantification of the quantities of interest: the source energy and key species source terms. In this paper, we expand on such architectures, specifically ChemTab, by introducing deep ensembles to approximate the posterior distribution of the quantities of interest. We investigate two strategies of creating these ensemble models: one that keeps the flamelet origin information (Flamelets strategy) and one that ignores the origin and considers all the data independently (Points strategy). To train these models we used flamelet data generated by the GRI--Mech 3.0 methane mechanism, which consists of 53 chemical species and 325 reactions. Our results demonstrate that the Flamelets strategy is superior in terms of the absolute prediction error for the quantities of interest, but is reliant on the types of flamelets used to train the ensemble. The Points strategy is best at capturing the variability of the quantities of interest, independent of the flamelet types. We conclude that, overall, ChemTab Deep Ensembles allows for a more accurate representation of the source energy and key species source terms, compared to the model without these modifications."}}

This poses limitations in use-case scenarios such as predicting visit counts of individuals' for a given spatial area at a particular temporal resolution using raster/image format representation of the geographical region, since the movement patterns of an individual can be largely restricted and localized to a certain part of the raster. Additionally, current deep-learning approaches for solving such problem doesn't account for the geographical awareness of a region while modelling the spatio-temporal movement patterns of an individual. To address these limitations, there is a need to develop a novel strategy and modeling approach that can handle both sparse, irregular data while incorporating geo-awareness in the model. In this paper, we make use of quadtree as the data structure for representing the image and introduce a novel geo-aware enabled deep learning layer, GA-ConvLSTM that performs the convolution operation based on a novel geo-aware module based on quadtree data structure for incorporating spatial dependencies while maintaining the recurrent mechanism for accounting for temporal dependencies. We present this approach in the context of the problem of predicting spatial behaviors of an individual (e.g., frequent visits to specific locations) through deep-learning based predictive model, GADST-Predict. Experimental results on two GPS based trace data shows that the proposed method is effective in handling frequency visits over different use-cases with considerable high accuracy."}}
