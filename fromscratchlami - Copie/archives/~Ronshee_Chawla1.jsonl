The side information consists of a finite collection of low-dimensional subspaces, one of which contains $\\theta^*$. In our setting, agents can collaborate to reduce regret by sending recommendations across a communication graph connecting them. We present a novel decentralized algorithm, where agents communicate subspace indices with each other and each agent plays a projected variant of LinUCB on the corresponding (low-dimensional) subspace. By distributing the search for the optimal subspace across users and learning of the unknown vector by each agent in the corresponding low-dimensional subspace, we show that the per-agent finite-time regret is much smaller than the case when agents do not communicate. We finally complement these results through simulations."}}

In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip style communications on an arbitrary connected graph. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\\Omega(\\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents."}}
