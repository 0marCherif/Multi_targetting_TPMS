As empirically there exists a strong correlation between the performance of teacher and student models, it is commonly believed that a high performing teacher is preferred. Consequently, practitioners tend to use a well trained network or an ensemble of them as the teacher. In this paper, we observe that an intermediate model, i.e., a checkpoint in the middle of the training procedure, often serves as a better teacher compared to the fully converged model, although the former has much lower accuracy. More surprisingly, a weak snapshot ensemble of several intermediate models from a same training trajectory can outperform a strong ensemble of independently trained and fully converged models, when they are used as teachers. We show that this phenomenon can be partially explained by the information bottleneck principle: the feature representations of intermediate models can have higher mutual information regarding the input, and thus contain more ``dark knowledge'' for effective distillation. We further propose an optimal intermediate teacher selection algorithm based on maximizing the total task-related mutual information. Experiments verify its effectiveness and applicability.

However, in many scenarios we may have limited samples for some novel sub-categories, leading to the fine-grained few shot learning (FG-FSL) setting. To address this challenging task, we propose a novel method named foreground object transformation (FOT), which is composed of a foreground object extractor and a posture transformation generator. The former aims to remove image background, which tends to increase the difficulty of fine-grained image classification as it amplifies the intra-class variance while reduces inter-class variance. The latter transforms the posture of the foreground object to generate additional samples for the novel sub-category. As a data augmentation method, FOT can be conveniently applied to any existing few shot learning algorithm and greatly improve its performance on FG-FSL tasks. In particular, in combination with FOT, simple fine-tuning baseline methods can be competitive with the state-of-the-art methods both in inductive setting and transductive setting. Moreover, FOT can further boost the performances of latest excellent methods and bring them up to the new state-of-the-art. In addition, we also show the effectiveness of FOT on general FSL tasks."}}

We propose a novel loss function, termed as CAM-loss, to constrain the embedded feature maps with the class activation maps (CAMs) which indicate the spatially discriminative regions of an image for particular categories. CAM-loss drives the backbone to express the features of target category and suppress the features of non-target categories or background, so as to obtain more discriminative feature representations. It can be simply applied in any CNN architecture with neglectable additional parameters and calculations. Experimental results show that CAM-loss is applicable to a variety of network structures and can be combined with mainstream regularization methods to improve the performance of image classification. The strong generalization ability of CAM-loss is validated in the transfer learning and few shot learning tasks. Based on CAM-loss, we also propose a novel CAAM-CAM matching knowledge distillation method. This method directly uses the CAM generated by the teacher network to supervise the CAAM generated by the student network, which effectively improves the accuracy and convergence rate of the student network."}}
