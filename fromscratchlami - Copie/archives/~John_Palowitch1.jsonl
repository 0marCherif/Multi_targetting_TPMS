Unfortunately, such graph datasets are often generated from online, highly privacy-restricted ecosystems, which makes research and development on these datasets hard, if not impossible. This greatly reduces the amount of benchmark graphs available to researchers, causing the field to rely only on a handful of publicly-available datasets. To address this dilemma, we introduce a novel graph generative model, Computation Graph Transformer (CGT) that can learn and reproduce the distribution of real-world graphs in a privacy-enhanced way. Our proposed model (1) generates effective benchmark graphs on which GNNs show similar task performance as on the source graphs, (2) scales to process large-scale real-world graphs, (3) guarantees privacy for end-users. Extensive experiments across a vast body of graph generative models show that only our model can successfully generate privacy-controlled, synthetic substitutes of large-scale real-world graphs that can be effectively used to evaluate GNN models."}}

State-of-the-art graph learning methods for HGs known as heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) are applied to learn deep context-informed node representations. However, many HG datasets from industrial applications suffer from label imbalance between node types. As there is no direct way to learn using labels rooted at different node types, HGNNs have been applied to only a few node types with abundant labels. We propose a zero-shot transfer learning module for HGNNs called a Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN) that transfers knowledge from label-abundant node types to zero-labeled node types through rich relational information given in the HG. KTN is derived from the theoretical relationship, which we introduce in this work, between distinct feature extractors for each node type given in an HGNN model. KTN improves the performance of 6 different types of HGNN models by up to 960% for inference on zero-labeled node types and outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning baselines by up to 73% across 18 different transfer learning tasks on HGs."}}

Many community detection methods for un-weighted networks have a theoretical basis in a null model. Communities discovered by these methods therefore have interpretations in terms of statistical significance. In this paper, we introduce a null for weighted networks called the continuous configuration model. First, we propose a community extraction algorithm for weighted networks which incorporates iterative hypothesis testing under the null. We prove a central limit theorem for edge-weight sums and asymptotic consistency of the algorithm under a weighted stochastic block model. We then incorporate the algorithm in a community detection method called CCME. To benchmark the method, we provide a simulation framework involving the null to plant \u00e2\u0080\u009cbackground\" nodes in weighted networks with communities. We show that the empirical performance of CCME on these simulations is competitive with existing methods, particularly when overlapping communities and background nodes are present. To further validate the method, we present two real-world networks with potential background nodes and analyze them with CCME, yielding results that reveal macro- features of the corresponding systems."}}

In this paper we argue that when such associations exist, any downstream Graph Neural Network (GNN) will be implicitly biased by these structural correlations. To allow control over this phenomenon, we introduce the Metadata-Orthogonal Node Embedding Training (MONET) unit, a general neural network module for performing training-time linear debiasing of graph embeddings. MONET operates by ensuring that the node embeddings are trained on a hyperplane orthogonal to that of the node features (metadata). Unlike debiasing approaches in similar domains, our method offers exact guarantees about the correlation between the resulting embeddings and any sensitive metadata. We illustrate the effectiveness of MONET though our experiments on a variety of real world graphs against challenging baselines (e.g. adversarial debiasing), showing superior performance in tasks such as preventing the leakage of political party affiliation in a blog network, and preventing the gaming of embedding-based recommendation systems."}}

It has, however, become hard to track the field's burgeoning progress. One reason is due to the very small number of datasets used in practice to benchmark the performance of graph learning algorithms. This shockingly small sample size (~10) allows for only limited scientific insight into the problem. In this work, we aim to address this deficiency. We propose to generate synthetic graphs, and study the behaviour of graph learning algorithms in a controlled scenario. We develop a fully-featured synthetic graph generator that allows deep inspection of different models. We argue that synthetic graph generations allows for thorough investigation of algorithms and provides more insights than overfitting on three citation datasets. In the case study, we show how our framework provides insight into unsupervised and supervised graph neural network models."}}
