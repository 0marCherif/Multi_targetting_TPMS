Current force platform-based re-ID systems classify a fixed set of identities (IDs), which presents a problem when IDs are added or removed from the database. We formulated force platform-based re-ID as a deep metric learning (DML) task, whereby a deep neural network learns a feature representation that can be compared between inputs using a distance metric. The force platform dataset used in this study is one of the largest and the most comprehensive of its kind, containing 193 IDs with significant variations in clothing, footwear, walking speed, and time between trials. Several DML model architectures were evaluated in a challenging setting where none of the IDs were seen during training (i.e., zero-shot re-ID) and there was only one prior sample per ID to compare with each query sample. The best architecture was 85% accurate in this setting, though an analysis of changes in walking speed and footwear between measurement instances revealed that accuracy was 28% higher on same-speed, same-footwear comparisons, compared to cross-speed, cross-footwear comparisons. These results demonstrate the potential of DML algorithms for zero-shot re-ID using force platform data, and highlight challenging cases."}}

Modern malware detectors rely on machine learning algorithms. Now, the adversarial objective is to devise alterations to the malware code to decrease the chance of being detected whilst preserving the functionality and realism of the malware. Adversarial learning is effective in improving robustness but generating functional and realistic adversarial malware samples is non-trivial. Because: i) in contrast to tasks capable of using gradient-based feedback, adversarial learning in a domain without a differentiable mapping function from the problem space (malware code inputs) to the feature space is hard; and ii) it is difficult to ensure the adversarial malware is realistic and functional. This presents a challenge for developing scalable adversarial machine learning algorithms for large datasets at a production or commercial scale to realize robust malware detectors. We propose an alternative; perform adversarial learning in the feature space in contrast to the problem space. We prove the projection of perturbed, yet valid malware, in the problem space into feature space will always be a subset of adversarials generated in the feature space. Hence, by generating a robust network against feature-space adversarial examples, we inherently achieve robustness against problem-space adversarial examples. We formulate a Bayesian adversarial learning objective that captures the distribution of models for improved robustness. We prove that our learning method bounds the difference between the adversarial risk and empirical risk explaining the improved robustness. We show that adversarially trained BNNs achieve state-of-the-art robustness. Notably, adversarially trained BNNs are robust against stronger attacks with larger attack budgets by a margin of up to 15% on a recent production-scale malware dataset of more than 20 million samples."}}

It relies on including high-confidence predictions made on unlabeled data as additional targets to train the model. We propose ProtoCon, a novel SSL method aimed at the less-explored label-scarce SSL where such methods usually underperform. ProtoCon refines the pseudo-labels by leveraging their nearest neighbours' information. The neighbours are identified as the training proceeds using an online clustering approach operating in an embedding space trained via a prototypical loss to encourage well-formed clusters. The online nature of ProtoCon allows it to utilise the label history of the entire dataset in one training cycle to refine labels in the following cycle without the need to store image embeddings. Hence, it can seamlessly scale to larger datasets at a low cost. Finally, ProtoCon addresses the poor training signal in the initial phase of training (due to fewer confident predictions) by introducing an auxiliary self-supervised loss. It delivers significant gains and faster convergence over state-of-the-art across 5 datasets, including CIFARs, ImageNet and DomainNet."}}

They report frequent positive correlations on benchmarks in computer vision and NLP. Surprisingly, they never observe inverse correlations suggesting necessary trade-offs. This matters to determine whether ID performance can serve as a proxy for OOD generalization. This paper shows that inverse correlations between ID and OOD performance do happen in real-world benchmarks. They could be missed in past studies because of a biased selection of models. We show an example on the WILDS-Camelyon17 dataset, using models from multiple training epochs and random seeds. Our observations are particularly striking with models trained with a regularizer that diversifies the solutions to the ERM objective. We nuance recommendations and conclusions made in past studies. (1) High OOD performance may sometimes require trading off ID performance.(2) Focusing on ID performance alone may not lead to optimal OOD performance: it can lead to diminishing and eventually negative returns in OOD performance. (3) Our example reminds that empirical studies only chart regimes achievable with existing methods: care is warranted in deriving prescriptive recommendations."}}

The extensive work on large vision-and-language models has shown that self-supervised learning is effective for pretraining multimodal interactions. In this technical report, we focus on visual representations. We review and evaluate self-supervised methods to leverage unlabeled images and pretrain a model, which we then fine-tune on a custom VQA task that allows controlled evaluation and diagnosis. We compare energy-based models (EBMs) with contrastive learning (CL). While EBMs are growing in popularity, they lack an evaluation on downstream tasks. We find that both EBMs and CL can learn representations from unlabeled images that enable training a VQA model on very little annotated data. In a simple setting similar to CLEVR, we find that CL representations also improve systematic generalization, and even match the performance of representations from a larger, supervised, ImageNet-pretrained model. However, we find EBMs to be difficult to train because of instabilities and high variability in their results. Although EBMs prove useful for OOD detection, other results on supervised energy-based training and uncertainty calibration are largely negative. Overall, CL currently seems a preferable option over EBMs."}}

Now, an adversary can arm themselves with a patch that is naturalistic, less malicious-looking, physically realizable, highly effective\u2014achieving high attack success rates, and universal. A TnT is universal because any input image captured with a TnT in the scene will: i) misguide a network (untargeted attack); or ii) force the network to make a malicious decision (targeted attack).
