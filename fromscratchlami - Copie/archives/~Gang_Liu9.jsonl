For image reconstruction, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have obtained some remarkable results, but the existing methods based on GANs have not achieved satisfactory reconstructed results in quality. In order to improve the quality, we propose a more effective multi-scale GAN for image reconstruction and the proposed method is called MS-GAN. The generator of MS-GAN uses an improved U-net to capture the important details from the sparse inputs. In MS-GAN, the parallel class activation maps (P-CAMs) and spectral normalization (SN) are added to U-net. P-CAMs are composed of two parallel class activation maps (CAMs) and can specifically guide the generator to focus on the important details of the images for a more realistic visual effect. For the training process, MS-GAN consists of two phases: the generating phase and the refinement phase. The generating phase is to use binary sparse edges and color domains to generate the preliminary images. The refinement phase is to further improve the quality of the preliminary images. Experimental verifications are conducted on some datasets, which include edges2shoes, edges2handbags and Getchu. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. The images reconstructed by MS-GAN is more photo-realistic in terms of visual effects."}}

Many researchers focus on developing methods for daytime via RGB images. Few research study the methods for night condition. The main reason is that the RGB-based image localization methods fail to work in dark scenes due to the low illumination. Thermal images capture temperature information instead of texture, making it well suitable for dark environments. However, thermal image-based localization methods are not well studied. To address it, we propose an attention-based localization method for night condition (DarkLoc) using thermal images. The proposed method introduce the attention mechanism in a deep learning-based framework to extract key information from low quality thermal images. The attention model can enforce the whole network focus on geometry meaningful feature in thermal images and thus improve the localization accuracy. We perform extensive experiment on the thermal image dataset. The results show that the attention model can enforce the whole network to learn geometry meaningful feature from thermal images and effectively locate the thermal image in real-time."}}

Since the input semantic label map lacks rich detailed information, it will generate blurry, low-detailed, and color-distorted images during con-version. We propose a new residual decoding network to solve the above problems, calling AsymmetricGAN. Compared with the traditional upsampling network, our proposed new residual module with skip and attention connections can better preserve the information in the original image to avoid the loss of details. We also propose a new module with channel and spatial attention mechanism as the main component of the network which can better retain useful information and make the edges of the synthesized image clearer and more abundant in the details. The experimental results on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the advantage of AsymmetricGAN over the state-of-the-art approaches, regarding both visual quality and the representative evaluating criteria."}}

Additionally, tags also help video platform operators to better organize and recommend videos to platform users. Previous approaches are mainly based on manually tagging or tag propagation via video content analysis, which is time-consuming and resource-consuming. Especially, given the high volume of fresh movies generated per year, it is difficult to accurately tag all the movies manually. Moreover, video content analysis is also not easy considering typical features (e.g., long duration, complicated scenarios) of commercial movies. In this paper, we propose an automatic tagging algorithm called TagRec that exploits crowdsourced user reviews to generate accurate movie tags. We observe that user reviews contain rich information about movies (e.g., quality, actors) which can be learned to generate high-quality movie tags. Inspired by the above observation, we choose to transform the movie video tagging problem into a tag recommendation problem, in which tags are recommended to different movies by extracting knowledge from crowdsourced movie reviews. We take latent topics, tag co-occurrence probability and tag semantics into account, and formulate the problem as a recommendation optimization problem. We evaluate the performance of our pro-posed TagRec algorithm with a large-scale real-world dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TagRec achieves 7.1 % and 9.6% improvement compared with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hit Ratio and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain respectively."}}

Most of previous approaches only utilize data from a single platform (e.g., view history) for prediction. However, such approaches cannot provide satisfactory prediction accuracy, as video popularity may be affected by many influential features dispersed over multiple platforms. In this paper, we focus on the popularity prediction of online movies and propose a prediction framework called DeepFusion to fuse salient features from multiple platforms so as to boost the accuracy of popularity prediction of online movies. For this purpose, we extract influential factors from Douban, which is a leading movie rating website in China, and Youku, which is one of the largest online video service providers in China. Considering the complexity incurred by numerous parameters, we choose to feed these influential factors into deep neural networks for prediction and thus avoid the limitation of traditional predictive models. Compared with previous approaches, our solution can significantly improve the prediction accuracy over 40%. Moreover, even for movies without any historical views, our approach can also well capture their popular trends and overcome the cold-start problem."}}

If a sensor node cannot communicate with the base station directly, it needs to select one of the senor nodes that it can communicate with and transfer the data to it. The above process will go on until the data arrive at the base station. It may cause too many relays during the process in which the data are transferred to the base station. Some nodes may quickly run out of energy and cause the entire wireless network to fail. We build a breadth-first search spanning tree which is rooted in base station according to the connected relation between the sensor nodes and the base station. When sensor nodes transfer the data to the base station, the data follow the path between the node and root in the spanning tree towards the base station. This algorithm guarantees the number of relays in the process and the total energy consumption of the wireless sensor network are the least. Thus the choice of the base station position is vital to the energy consumption of the whole wireless sensor network. This paper proposes an algorithm for the base station placement that finds the optimal base station position by using computation geometry according to the relative relation between the senor nodes. In contrast to the grid computing we are familiar, this algorithm greatly reduces the computing time required by finding the optimal position of base station."}}

Skewed data streams in real world are very common and pose a great challenge to these systems, especially for stateful applications. Key splitting, which allows a single key to be routed to multiple workers, is a great idea to achieve good balance of load in the cluster. However, it comes with the cost of increased memory consumption and computation overhead as well as network communication. In this paper, we present a new definition of metric to model the cost of key splitting for intra-operator parallelism in stream processing systems and provide a novel perspective to reduce replication factor while keeping both overall load imbalance and processing latency low. Similar to previous work, our approach treats the head and the tail of the distribution differently in order to reduce memory requirements. For the head, it uses our proposed notion of regional load imbalance to decide dynamically whether to make one more worker responsible for the heavy hitter or not. For the tail, it simply uses hash partitioning to keep the size of the routing table for the head as small as possible. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach provides superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art partitioning algorithms in terms of load imbalance, replication factor and latency over different levels of skewed stream distributions."}}

The U-net is a frequently used convolutional network architecture in deep learning technology and is mainly used for image segmentation. Currently, the U-net has been used for photographic image synthesis. However, the attenuation of image description information, the low memory capacity of the network and the checkerboard artifacts in the output images cause the low quality of the images synthesized by the U-net. In order to solve the above problems, this paper presents an improved U-net (IUN) for photographic image synthesis. In IUN, the image description map is resized to the multiple resolutions and the resized images are merged into the different layers of IUN for enhancing the image description information. The resize-convolution layers in IUN replaces the deconvolution layers in the U-net to reduce the checkerboard artifacts. The proposed learnable residual blocks increase the memory capacity of the network. IUN can be easy trained end-to-end with the image description map and the corresponding photographic image. In experiments on datasets, two types of image description information, semantic and sketch, are used to synthesize the photographic images. Compared to the optimization-based networks, cascaded refinement networks (CRNs) and other methods, IUN gives more realistic results. Additionally, our network achieves a balance between memory capacity and time cost."}}
