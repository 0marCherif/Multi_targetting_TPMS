However, the existing studies only consider the multiscale features containing changed and unchanged compo\u0002nents, which is difficult to represent the subtle changes between bitemporal HSIs in each scale. To address this problem, we pro\u0002pose a multiscale diff-changed feature fusion network (MSDFFN) for HSI CD, which improves the ability of feature representation by learning the refined change components between bitemporal HSIs under different scales. In this network, a temporal fea\u0002ture encoder\u2013decoder subnetwork, which combines a reduced inception (RI) module and a cross-layer attention module to highlight the significant features, is designed to extract the temporal features of HSIs. A bidirectional diff-changed feature representation (BDFR) module is proposed to learn the fine changed features of bitemporal HSIs at various scales to enhance the discriminative performance of the subtle change. A multiscale attention fusion (MSAF) module is developed to adaptively fuse the changed features of various scales. The proposed method can not only discover the subtle change in bitemporal HSIs but also improve the discriminating power for HSI CD. Experimental results on three HSI datasets show that MSDFFN outperforms a few state-of-the-art methods."}}
