Planning with preferences involves generating plans that optimize for properties of the plan instead of, or in addition to, trying to reach a fixed goal. Epistemic planning allows for planning over the knowledge or belief states of one or more agents for the purpose of achieving epistemic goals (where agents have particular states of knowledge or belief). In this paper we motivate and explore the task of planning with epistemic preferences, proposing a method by which existing automated planning techniques can be combined for this purpose. Epistemic preferences may better allow for representing what humans want, and have benefits for AI safety."}}

We investigate some basic planning problems with interesting properties and establish fundamental characteristics of the corresponding semigroups, such as their ideals and Green's relations. Furthermore, we leverage semigroup theory to propose new approaches to existing concepts in automated planning, including the identification of landmark actions and the study of dead ends. We demonstrate that algebraic results can be applied to facilitate an understanding of a planning problem's state space and explore its solutions, thus verifying the relevance and effectiveness of such formal modeling."}}

The transformation can only make small local changes and may not leave the solution space. An important example is the independent set reconfiguration (ISR) problem, where an independent set of a graph (a subset of its vertices without edges between them) has to be transformed into another one by a sequence of modifications that remove a vertex or add another that is not adjacent to any vertex in the set. The 1st Combinatorial Reconfiguration Challenge (CoRe Challenge 2022) was a competition focused on the ISR problem. Our team participated with two solvers that model the ISR problem as a planning problem and employ different planning techniques for solving it. They successfully competed in the challenge and were awarded 4 first, 3 second, and 3 third places across 9 tracks. In this work, we present the ISR problem as a new problem to the planning community and describe the planning techniques used in our solvers. We re-ran the entire competition under equal computational conditions to allow for a fair comparison. Besides showcasing the success of planning technology, we hope that this work will create a cross-fertilization of the two research fields."}}

Generalizing Causal Link Explanations to Fully Observable Non-Deterministic Planning Problems", "abstract": "The problem of designing automated agents, particularly automated planning agents that can explain their decisions has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. The field of explainable planning or XAIP has already made a lot of progress in recent years and many of them centered around the problem of explaining decisions derived for classical planning problems. As the field progresses there is interest in tackling problems from more complex planning formalisms. However, one important aspect to keep in mind as we start focusing on such settings is that the explanatory challenges we study in the context of classical planning problems do not disappear when we move to more general settings but are just magnified. As such, when we move to these more general settings, a significant challenge before us is to see how one could generalize the well-established methods studied in the context of classical planning problems to these new settings. To provide a concrete example for this new research program we will start with causal link explanations, one of the earliest and most widely used explanations techniques used in the context of policies generated for fully observable non-deterministic planning problems. This would see us generalizing a concept that was originally developed for a specific solution concept, i.e, sequential plans, and see them applied to a very different solution concept (i.e. policies). We will develop a compilation-based method for generating generalized causal link explanations and show how as the domain is limited to deterministic cases, our method would generate causal link chains as identified by earlier works."}}

Prior work in this area has predominantly focused on the identification of specifications that satisfy all plan traces within a set, however more recently, contrastive approaches concerning the delineation of two sets have also been established. While these approaches are effective in their defined scope, they assume the existence of only one or two behavioural clusters. In this paper, we re-imagine contrastive specification learning by proposing a novel tree generation technique which allows k clusters to be discovered. By embracing a Monte Carlo node-splitting approach, our algorithm seeks balance to contrastively divide any given set of plan traces into two sets with an accompanying temporal logic specification satisfying one of the sets. Recursing this procedure, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to cluster and delineate plan traces, allowing temporal logic specifications to evoke insight at each level of the resulting tree."}}

A key property of this representation is that there are multiple representations of a network which can be obtained by permuting the order of the neurons. These representations are generally not compatible and attempting to transfer part of a network without the preceding layers is usually destructive to any learned relationships. This paper proposes a method by which a neural network is represented in terms of an embedding of the neurons rather than explicit weights. In addition to reducing the number of free parameters, this encoding is agnostic to the ordering of neurons, bypassing a key problem for weight-based representations. This allows us to transplant individual neurons and layers into another network and still maintain their functionality. This is particularly important for tasks like transfer learning and neuroevolution. We show through experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets that this method is capable of representing networks which achieve identical performance to direct weight representation, and that transfer done this way preserves much of the performance between two networks that are distant in parameter space."}}

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n\nIn this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a \\emph{declarative} representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology.\nOur proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans / dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically."}}

While such approaches are fast and usually result in acceptable behavior, existing methods are not mission aware. There is no concept of utility maximization, no capability to handle flows with specified deadlines and loss requirements, and no guarantees over the probability of network saturation. In the presence of network degradation due to attacks, there is no guarantee that important flows will be properly transported. In this paper, we present RADMAX, a system for Risk And Deadline Aware Planning for Maximum Utility based on constraint programming, which allows us to handle higher level mission specifications. We show the correctness of RADMAX with respect to loss and delay bounds, provide results for the optimality of RADMAX with respect to the mission utility, and review current results on computational performance."}}

State of the art techniques rely on so-called bounded synthesis methods, which reduce the problem to a safety game. Realizability is determined by solving synthesis in a dual game. We provide a unified view of duality, and introduce novel bounded realizability methods via reductions to reachability games. Further, we introduce algorithms, based on AI automated planning, to solve these safety and reachability games. This is the the first complete approach to LTL realizability and synthesis via automated planning. Experiments illustrate that reductions to reachability games are an alternative to reductions to safety games, and show that planning can be a competitive approach to LTL realizability and synthesis."}}
