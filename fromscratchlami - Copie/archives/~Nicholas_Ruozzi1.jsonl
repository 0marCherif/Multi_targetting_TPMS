Previous approaches either grasp or push an object and then obtain the segmentation mask of the grasped or pushed object after one action. Instead, our system defers the decision on segmenting objects after a sequence of robot pushing actions. By applying multi-object tracking and video object segmentation on the images collected via robot pushing, our system can generate segmentation masks of all the objects in these images in a self-supervised way. These include images where objects are very close to each other, and segmentation errors usually occur on these images for existing object segmentation networks. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by fine-tuning segmentation networks trained on synthetic data with real-world data collected by our system. We show that, after fine-tuning, the segmentation accuracy of the networks is significantly improved both in the same domain and across different domains. In addition, we verify that the fine-tuned networks improve top-down robotic grasping of unseen objects in the real world."}}

More recently, combined DNN-CRF approaches have been considered, but their speed and practical performance still falls short of the best performing pure DNN solutions. In this work, we present a generic combined approach in which a log-supermodular CRF acts as a regularizer to encourage similarity between outputs in a structured prediction task.  We show that this combined approach is widely applicable, practical (it incurs only a moderate overhead on top of the base DNN solution) and, in some cases, it can rival carefully engineered pure DNN solutions for the same structured prediction task.

However, most of these models have been restricted to discrete domains owing to the complexity of inference in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce Relational Neural Markov Random Fields (RN-MRFs) that allow handling of complex relational hybrid domains, i.e., those that include discrete and continuous quantities, and we propose a maximum pseudolikelihood estimation-based learning algorithm with importance sampling for training the neural potential parameters. The key advantage of our approach is that it makes minimal data distributional assumptions and can seamlessly embed human knowledge through potentials or relational rules. Our empirical evaluations across diverse domains, such as image processing and relational object mapping, demonstrate its practical utility."}}

Here, we investigate weighted homomorphism counting problems over bipartite graphs that are related to a conjecture of Sidorenko. We show that the BFE does yield a lower bound in a variety of natural settings, and when it does yield a lower bound, it necessarily improves upon the lower bound conjectured by Sidorenko. Conversely, we show that there exist bipartite graphs for which the BFE does not yield a lower bound on the homomorphism number. Finally, we use the characterizations developed as part of this work to provide a simple proof of Sidorenko\u2019s conjecture in a number of special cases."}}

In this work, we extend the cutset network (CN) framework, a powerful sub-class of TPMs that often outperforms probabilistic graphical models in terms of prediction accuracy, to the temporal domain. This extension, dubbed dynamic cutset networks (DCNs), uses a CN to model the prior distribution and a conditional CN to model the transition distribution. We show that although exact inference is intractable when ar- arbitrary conditional CNs are used, particle filtering is efficient. To ensure tractability of exact inference, we introduce a novel conditional model called AND/OR conditional cutset networks and show that under certain restrictions exact inference is linear in the size of the corresponding constrained DCN. Experiments on several sequential datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our framework."}}

However, these results indicating that VR tracking data should be understood as personally identifying data were based on observing 360\u00b0 videos. In this paper, we present results based on sessions of user tracking data from an ecologically valid VR training application, which indicate that the prior claims may not be as applicable for identifying users beyond the context of observing 360\u00b0 videos. Our results indicate that the degree of identification accuracy notably decreases between VR sessions. Furthermore, we present results indicating that user tracking data can be obfuscated by encoding positional data as velocity data, which has been successfully used to predict other user experience outcomes like simulator sickness and knowledge acquisition. These results, which show identification accuracies were reduced by more than half, indicate that velocity-based encoding can be used to reduce identifiability and help protect personal identifying data."}}
