In this way, by incorporating complex physical knowledge in the form of the low-fidelity model, we find that a PEDS surrogate can be trained with at least 10\u00d7 less data than a \u201cblack-box\u201d neural network for the same accuracy. Asymptotically, PEDS appears to learn with a steeper power law than black-box surrogates, and benefits even further in combination with active learning. We demonstrate this using an example problem in electromagnetic scattering that appears in the large-scale optimization of optical metamaterials using scientific computing."}}
