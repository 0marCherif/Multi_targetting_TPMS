DTL treats the outputs of a network as a truth assignment of a temporal logic formula, and computes a temporal logic loss reflecting the consistency between the output and the constraints. We propose a comprehensive set of constraints, which are implicit in data annotations, and incorporate them with deep networks via DTL. We evaluate the effectiveness of DTL on the temporal action segmentation task and observe improved performance and reduced logical errors in the output of different task models. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis to visualize the desirable effects of DTL."}}

One important facet of human evolution is through narrative imagination, be it fictional or factual, and to tell the tale to other individuals. The factual narrative, such as news, journalism, field report, etc., is based on real-world events and often requires extensive human efforts to create. In the era of big data where video capture devices are commonly available everywhere, a massive amount of raw videos (including life-logging, dashcam or surveillance footage) are generated daily. As a result, it is rather impossible for humans to digest and analyze these video data. This paper reviews the problem of computational narrative generation where a goal-driven narrative (in the form of text with or without video) is generated from a single or multiple long videos. Importantly, the narrative generation problem makes itself distinguished from the existing literature by its focus on a comprehensive understanding of user goal, narrative structure and open-domain input. We tentatively outline a general narrative generation framework and discuss the potential research problems and challenges in this direction. Informed by the real-world impact of narrative generation, we then illustrate several practical use cases in Video Logging as a Service platform which enables users to get more out of the data through a goal-driven intelligent storytelling AI agent."}}

The advent of each task often accompanies the release of a large-scale annotated dataset, for supervised training of deep network. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to manually label sufficient amount of training data. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can leverage off-the-shelf labeled dataset to learn useful knowledge for the target task. While previous works mostly focus on transfer learning from a single source, we study multi-source transfer across domains and tasks (MS-DTT), in a semi-supervised setting. We propose GradMix, a model-agnostic method applicable to any model trained with gradient-based learning rule, to transfer knowledge via gradient descent by weighting and mixing the gradients from all sources during training. GradMix follows a meta-learning objective, which assigns layer-wise weights to the source gradients, such that the combined gradient follows the direction that minimize the loss for a small set of samples from the target dataset. In addition, we propose to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each mini-batch based on its importance to the target task, and a pseudo-labeling method to leverage the unlabeled samples in the target domain. We conduct MS-DTT experiments on two tasks: digit recognition and action recognition, and demonstrate the advantageous performance of the proposed method against multiple baselines."}}
