Given a new profile, we predict one of its time-series given the others in a streaming manner. Variational inference is used for tractability. This includes an online formulation of the projected process approximation of GPs to handle real-time prediction. We demonstrate our method on predicting the body-core temperature of subjects given their heart-rate and skin temperature."}}

As heat-related illnesses are associated with a rise in body core temperature (Tc), a reliable system for real-time assessment of Tc is useful to minimize heat casualties. However, invasive measurement of Tc (such as rectal, intestinal and esophageal temperature) is impractical in the field settings. This paper describes the model construction and qualification results of tracking Tc using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on physiological data recorded from wearable sensors. Tc, surface skin temperature (Tsk) and heart rate (HR) data were collected from three studies with different experimental protocols, climatic conditions and soldier volunteers. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated by cross-validation and external validation. The final EKF model was implemented using a nonlinear (cubic) state-space model (Tsk versus Tc) with a stage-wise, autoregressive exogenous model (incorporating HR) as the time update model. Overall, when tested against an independent dataset, the model showed a prediction bias of 0.11\u00b0C, a root mean square deviation of 0.29\u00b0C, and 87% of all Tc predictions fell within \u00b10.3\u00b0C of the measured Tc values. The results from our study indicate that the derived EKF model is accurate enough to calculate subject-specific Tc for the minimization of heat injuries."}}

We propose an approach to detect such users from the sentiment of the textual content in online forums. Since trolls typically express negative sentiments in their posts, we derive features from sentiment analysis, and use SVM <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rank</sup> to do binary and ordinal classification of trolls. With a small labeled training set of 20 users, we achieved 60% and 58% generalized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for binary and ordinal troll classification on our forum data respectively. In our experiments, we used features derived from a recursive neural tensor network sentiment analysis model trained on a movie reviews data set written in standard English. However, our forum data set contains messages in a wide spectrum of topics, and are often written in Colloquial Singapore English. We applied domain adaptation techniques to the sentiment analysis model using un-annotated forum data, and achieved a final result of 78% and 69% generalized ROC for binary and ordinal troll classification respectively."}}

This objective function, called the policy Gibbs error, is the expected error rate of a random classifier drawn from the prior distribution on the examples adaptively selected by the active learning policy. Exact maximization of the policy Gibbs error is hard, so we propose a greedy strategy that maximizes the Gibbs error at each iteration, where the Gibbs error on an instance is the expected error of a random classifier selected from the posterior label distribution on that instance. We apply this maximum Gibbs error criterion to three active learning scenarios: non-adaptive, adaptive, and batch active learning. In each scenario, we prove that the criterion achieves near-maximal policy Gibbs error when constrained to a fixed budget. For practical implementations, we provide approximations to the maximum Gibbs error criterion for Bayesian conditional random fields and transductive Naive Bayes. Our experimental results on a named entity recognition task and a text classification task show that the maximum Gibbs error criterion is an effective active learning criterion for noisy models."}}

One important and standard task is multi-class classification, which is the categorization of an item into one of several fixed classes. A usual likelihood function for this is the multinomial logistic likelihood function. However, exact inference with this model has proved to be difficult because high-dimensional integrations are required. In this paper, we propose a variational approximation to this model, and we describe the optimization of the variational parameters. Experiments have shown our approximation to be tight. In addition, we provide data-independent bounds on the marginal likelihood of the model, one of which is shown to be much tighter than the existing variational mean-field bound in the experiments. We also derive a proper lower bound on the predictive likelihood that involves the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and the true posterior. We combine our approach with a recently proposed sparse approximation to give a variational sparse approximation to the Gaussian process multi-class model. We also derive criteria which can be used to select the inducing set, and we show the effectiveness of these criteria over random selection in an experiment."}}
