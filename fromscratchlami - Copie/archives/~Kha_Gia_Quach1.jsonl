Indeed, we propose a new real-time Depth Perspective-aware Multiple Object Tracking (DP-MOT) approach to tackle the occlusion problem in MOT. A simple yet efficient Subject-Ordered Depth Estimation (SODE) is first proposed to automatically order the depth positions of detected subjects in a 2D scene in an unsupervised manner. Using the output from SODE, a new Active pseudo-3D Kalman filter, a simple but effective extension of Kalman filter with dynamic control variables, is then proposed to dynamically update the movement of objects. In addition, a new high-order association approach is presented in the data association step to incorporate first-order and second-order relationships between the detected objects. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent MOT methods on standard MOT benchmarks."}}

Thus, it is important for object detection and tracking to address new challenges, such as achieving consistent results across views of cameras. To address these challenges, this work presents a new Global Association Graph Model with Link Prediction approach to predict existing tracklets location and link detections with tracklets via cross-attention motion modeling and appearance re-identification. This approach aims at solving issues caused by inconsistent 3D object detection. Moreover, our model exploits to improve the detection ac-curacy of a standard 3D object detector in the nuScenes detection challenge. The experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method to produce SOTA performance on the existing vision-based tracking dataset."}}

However, it is limited when dealing with multi-instance objects in the real world. In addition, its segmentation results are quite sensitive to initial settings and highly depend on the number of iterations. To address these issues and boost the classic variational LS methods to a new level of the learnable deep learning approaches, we propose a novel definition of contour evolution named Recurrent Level Set (RLS)1 to employ Gated Recurrent Unit under the energy minimization of a variational LS functional. The curve deformation process in RLS is formed as a hidden state evolution procedure and updated by minimizing an energy functional composed of fitting forces and contour length. By sharing the convolutional features in a fully end-to-end trainable framework, we extend RLS to Contextual RLS (CRLS) to address semantic segmentation in the wild. The experimental results have shown that our proposed RLS improves both computational time and segmentation accuracy against the classic variational LS-based method whereas the fully end-to-end system CRLS achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches.

Despite a large number of existing works, solving the data association problem in any MC-MOT pipeline is arguably one of the most challenging tasks. Developing a robust MC-MOT system, however, is still highly challenging due to many practical issues such as inconsistent lighting conditions, varying object movement patterns, or the trajectory occlusions of the objects between the cameras. To address these problems, this work, therefore, proposes a new Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction (DyGLIP) approach to solve the data association task. Compared to existing methods, our new model offers several advantages, including better feature representations and the ability to recover from lost tracks during camera transitions. Moreover, our model works gracefully regardless of the overlapping ratios between the cameras. Experimental results show that we outperform existing MC-MOT algorithms by a large margin on several practical datasets. Notably, our model works favorably on online settings but can be extended to an incremental approach for large-scale datasets."}}

However, such systems are built on GPU platforms and mostly deploy heavy deep network architectures. Given a high-performance heavy network as a teacher, this work presents a simple and elegant teacher-student learning paradigm, namely ShrinkTeaNet, to train a portable student network that has significantly fewer parameters and competitive accuracy against the teacher network. Far apart from prior teacher-student frameworks mainly focusing on accuracy and compression ratios in closed-set problems, our proposed teacher-student network is proved to be more robust against open-set problem, i.e. large-scale face recognition. In addition, this work introduces a novel Angular Distillation Loss for distilling the feature direction and the sam- ple distributions of the teacher\u2019s hypersphere to its student. Then ShrinkTeaNet framework can efficiently guide the student\u2019s learning process with the teacher\u2019s knowledge presented in both intermediate and last stages of the feature embedding. Evaluations on LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, IJB-B and IJB-C Janus, and MegaFace with one million distractors have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach to learn robust student networks which have satisfying accuracy and compact sizes. Our ShrinkTeaNet is able to support the light-weight architecture achieving high performance with 99.77% on LFW and 95.64% on large-scale Megaface protocols."}}

It is because the limitations of accessible information from that engine including its structure and uninterpretable extracted features. This paper presents a novel generative structure with Bijective Metric Learning, namely Bijective Generative Adversarial Networks in a Distillation framework (DiBiGAN), for synthesizing faces of an identity given that person's features. In order to effectively address this problem, this work firstly introduces a bijective metric so that the distance measurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain for an image reconstruction task. Secondly, a distillation process is introduced to maximize the information exploited from the blackbox face recognition engine. Then a Feature-Conditional Generator Structure with Exponential Weighting Strategy is presented for a more robust generator that can synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation. Results on several benchmarking datasets including CelebA, LFW, AgeDB, CFP-FP against matching engines have demonstrated the effectiveness of DiBiGAN on both image realism and ID preservation properties."}}

We investigate that segmenting a brain tumor is facing to the imbalanced data problem where the number of pixels belonging to the background class (non tumor pixel) is much larger than the number of pixels belonging to the foreground class (tumor pixel). To address this problem, we propose a multitask network which is formed as a cascaded structure. Our model consists of two targets, i.e., (i) effectively differentiate the brain tumor regions and (ii) estimate the brain tumor mask. The first objective is performed by our proposed contextual brain tumor detection network, which plays a role of an attention gate and focuses on the region around brain tumor only while ignoring the far neighbor background which is less correlated to the tumor. Different from other existing object detection networks which process every pixel, our contextual brain tumor detection network only processes contextual regions around ground-truth instances and this strategy aims at producing meaningful regions proposals. The second objective is built upon a 3D atrous residual network and under an encode-decode network in order to effectively segment both large and small objects (brain tumor). Our 3D atrous residual network is designed with a skip connection to enables the gradient from the deep layers to be directly propagated to shallow layers, thus, features of different depths are preserved and used for refining each other. In order to incorporate larger contextual information from volume MRI data, our network utilizes the 3D atrous convolution with various kernel sizes, which enlarges the receptive field of filters. Our proposed network has been evaluated on various datasets including BRATS2015, BRATS2017 and BRATS2018 datasets with both validation set and testing set. Our performance has been benchmarked by both region-based metrics and surface-based metrics. We also have conducted comparisons against state-of-the-art approaches. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sup> Code and models will be publicly available."}}
