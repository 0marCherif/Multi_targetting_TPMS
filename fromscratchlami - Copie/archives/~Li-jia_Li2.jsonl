Building a highly accurate prediction model for these tasks usually requires a large number of images manually annotated with labels and finding sites of abnormalities. In reality, however, such annotated data are expensive to acquire, especially the ones with location annotations. We need methods that can work well with only a small amount of location annotations. To address this challenge, we present a unified approach that simultaneously performs disease identification and localization through the same underlying model for all images. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively leverage both class information as well as limited location annotation, and significantly outperforms the comparative reference baseline in both classification and localization tasks."}}

In contrast to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which aims at automating neural network architecture design, active learning aims at automating training data selection process. It is especially critical for training a long-tailed task, in which positive samples are sparsely distributed. Active learning alleviates the expensive data annotation issue through incrementally training models powered with efficient data selection. Instead of annotating all unlabeled samples, it iteratively selects and annotates the most valuable samples. Active learning has been popular in image classification, but has not been fully explored in object detection. Most of current works on object detection are evaluated with different settings, making it difficult to fairly compare their performance. To facilitate the research in this field, this paper contributes an active learning benchmark framework named as ALBench for evaluating active learning in object detection. Developed on an automatic deep model training system, this ALBench framework is easy-to-use, compatible with different active learning algorithms, and ensures the same training and testing protocols. We hope this automated benchmark system helps researchers to easily reproduce literature's performance and have fair comparisons with prior arts."}}
