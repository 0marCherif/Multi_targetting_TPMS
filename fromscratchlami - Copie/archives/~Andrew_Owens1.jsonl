Estimating a sound's time delay requires finding correspondences between the signals recorded by each microphone. We propose to learn these correspondences through self-supervision, drawing on recent techniques from visual tracking. We adapt the contrastive random walk of Jabri et al. to learn a cycle-consistent representation from unlabeled stereo sounds, resulting in a model that performs on par with supervised methods on \"in the wild\" internet recordings. We also propose a multimodal contrastive learning model that solves a visually-guided localization task: estimating the time delay for a particular person in a multi-speaker mixture, given a visual representation of their face.

We take inspiration from Video Textures [43], which showed that plausible new videos could be generated from a single one by stitching its frames together in a novel yet consistent order. This classic work, however, was constrained by its use of hand-designed distance metrics, limiting its use to simple, repetitive videos. We draw on recent techniques from self-supervised learning to learn this distance metric, allowing us to compare frames in a manner that scales to more challenging dynamics, and to condition on other data, such as audio. We learn representations for video frames and frame-to-frame transition probabilities by fitting a video-specific model trained using contrastive learning. To synthesize a texture, we randomly sample frames with high transition probabilities to generate diverse temporally smooth videos with novel sequences and transitions. The model naturally extends to an audio-conditioned setting without requiring any finetuning. Our model outperforms baselines on human perceptual scores, can handle a diverse range of input videos, and can combine semantic and audiovisual cues in order to synthesize videos that synchronize well with an audio signal."}}

Yet, approaches that dominate each space differ. We take a step towards bridging this gap by extending the recent contrastive random walk formulation to much denser, pixel-level space-time graphs. The main contribution is introducing hierarchy into the search problem by computing the transition matrix between two frames in a coarse-to-fine manner, forming a multiscale contrastive random walk when extended in time. This establishes a unified technique for self-supervised learning of optical flow, keypoint tracking, and video object segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that, for each of these tasks, the unified model achieves performance competitive with strong self-supervised approaches specific to that task.

Given an object's shape and a distribution of viewpoints from which it will be seen, we estimate a texture that will make it difficult to detect. Successfully solving this task requires a model that can accurately reproduce textures from the scene, while simultaneously dealing with the highly conflicting constraints imposed by each viewpoint. We address these challenges with a model based on texture fields and adversarial learning. Our model learns to camouflage a variety of object shapes from randomly sampled locations and viewpoints within the input scene, and is the first to address the problem of hiding complex object shapes. Using a human visual search study, we find that our estimated textures conceal objects significantly better than previous methods. Project site: https://rrrrrguo.github.io/ganmouflage/"}}

In this paper, we present a method for learning visual styles from unlabeled audio-visual data. Our model learns to manipulate the texture of a scene to match a sound, a problem we term audio-driven image stylization. Given a dataset of paired audio-visual data, we learn to modify input images such that, after manipulation, they are more likely to co-occur with a given input sound. In quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our sound-based model outperforms label-based approaches. We also show that audio can be an intuitive representation for manipulating images, as adjusting a sound's volume or mixing two sounds together results in predictable changes to visual style.

We ask whether these ambient sounds convey information about 3D scene structure and, if so, whether they provide a useful learning signal for multimodal models. To study this, we collect a dataset of paired audio and RGB-D recordings from a variety of quiet indoor scenes. We then train models that estimate the distance to nearby walls, given only audio as input. We also use these recordings to learn multimodal representations through self-supervision, by training a network to associate images with their corresponding sounds. These results suggest that ambient sound conveys a surprising amount of information about scene structure, and that it is a useful signal for learning multimodal features."}}

In this paper, we propose a simple change to existing image similarity metrics that makes them more robust to positional errors: we match the images using optical flow, then measure the visual similarity of corresponding pixels. This change leads to crisper and more perceptually accurate predictions, and does not require modifications to the image prediction network. We apply our method to a variety of video prediction tasks, where it obtains strong performance with simple network architectures, and to the closely related task of video interpolation.
