Following recent work in constraint-posting scheduling, we formulate this problem as one of establishing ordering relations between pairs of operations requiring synchronization of resource usage. This establishes contact with the recently proposed General Temporal Constraint Network (GTCN) model. Exploiting properties of the general GTCN solution procedure, we are able to directly generalize a high performance solution procedure previously developed for a much more restricted class of scheduling problems. Specifically, shortest path information in the underlying temporal constraint network is first used to establish dominance conditions for early pruning of infeasible solutions. Heuristics are then defined for variable/value ordering in the meta-CSP space of possible resolutions of the disjunctive constraints on resource usage. These heuristics are based on use of shortest path information as an estimation of decision flexibility. Experimental evaluation of the resulting heuristic procedure is carried out on a set of randomly generated problems drawn from a manufacturing scenario. Results indicate extremely effective problem solving performance in relation to both the original scheduling procedure that was adapted and the general GTCN solution procedure."}}

The hypothesis underlying our approach is that by approaching the problem as one of establishing sequencing constraints between pairs of operations requiring the same resource (as opposed to a problem of assigning start times to each operation) and by exploiting previously developed analysis techniques for limiting search through the space of possible sequencing decisions, simple, localized look-ahead techniques can yield problem solving performance comparable to currently dominating techniques that rely on more sophisticated analysis of resource contention. We define a series of attention focusing heuristics based on simple analysis of the temporal flexibility associated with different sequencing decisions, and a similarly motivated heuristic for determining how to sequence a given operation pair. Performance results are reported on a suite of benchmark problems previously investigated by two advanced approaches, and our simplified look-ahead analysis techniques are shown to provide comparable problem solving leverage at reduced computational cost."}}
