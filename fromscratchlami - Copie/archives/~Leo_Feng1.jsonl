NPs comprise of a conditioning phase where a context dataset is encoded, a querying phase where the model makes predictions using the context dataset encoding, and an updating phase where the model updates its encoding with newly received datapoints. However, state-of-the-art methods require additional memory which scales linearly or quadratically with the size of the dataset, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant which only requires constant memory for the conditioning, querying, and updating phases. In building CMANPs, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel general-purpose attention block that can compute its output in constant memory and perform updates in constant computation. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on meta-regression and image completion tasks while being (1) significantly more memory efficient than prior methods and (2) more scalable to harder settings."}}

Conversely, existing sub-quadratic NP variants perform significantly worse than that of TNPs. Tackling this issue, we propose Efficient Queries Transformer Neural Processes (EQTNPs), a more computationally efficient NP variant. The model encodes the context dataset into a set of vectors that is linear in the number of context datapoints. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the context vectors. We empirically show that EQTNPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art."}}

The results suggest that the superior performance of state-of-the-art methods is owed to training a more generalizable classifier rather than their proposed selection mechanisms. We argue that the best performing selection mechanism should instead be rooted in the classifier itself. Our proposed selection strategy uses the classification scores and achieves better results by a significant margin, consistently, across all coverages and all datasets, without any added compute cost. Furthermore, inspired by semi-supervised learning, we propose an entropy-based regularizer that improves the performance of selective classification methods.

The problem can be framed as a global optimization problem where the objective is an expensive black-box function such that we can query large batches restricted with a limitation of a low number of rounds. Bayesian Optimization is a principled method for tackling this problem. However, the astronomically large state space of biological sequences renders brute-force iterating over all possible sequences infeasible. In this paper, we propose MetaRLBO where we train an autoregressive generative model via Meta-Reinforcement Learning to propose promising sequences for selection via Bayesian Optimization. We pose this problem as that of finding an optimal policy over a distribution of MDPs induced by sampling subsets of the data acquired in the previous rounds. Our in-silico experiments show that meta-learning over such ensembles provides robustness against reward misspecification and achieves competitive results compared to existing strong baselines."}}
