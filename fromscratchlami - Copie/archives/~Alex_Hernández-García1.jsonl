The generation of this energy comes with an environmental cost in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, depending on quantity used and the energy source. Existing research on the environmental impacts of ML has been limited to analyses covering a small number of models and does not adequately represent the diversity of ML models and tasks. In the current study, we present a survey of the carbon emissions of 95 ML models across time and different tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. We analyze them in terms of the energy sources used, the amount of CO2 emissions produced, how these emissions evolve across time and how they relate to model performance. We conclude with a discussion regarding the carbon footprint of our field and propose the creation of a centralized repository for reporting and tracking these emissions."}}

While science has traditionally relied on trial and error and even serendipity to a large extent, the last few decades have seen a surge of data-driven scientific discoveries. However, in order to truly leverage large-scale data sets and high-throughput experimental setups, machine learning methods will need to be further improved and better integrated in the scientific discovery pipeline. A key challenge for current machine learning methods in this context is the efficient exploration of very large search spaces, which requires techniques for estimating reducible (epistemic) uncertainty and generating sets of diverse and informative experiments to perform. This motivated a new probabilistic machine learning framework called GFlowNets, which can be applied in the modeling, hypotheses generation and experimental design stages of the experimental science loop. GFlowNets learn to sample from a distribution given indirectly by a reward function corresponding to an unnormalized probability, which enables sampling diverse, high-reward candidates. GFlowNets can also be used to form efficient and amortized Bayesian posterior estimators for causal models conditioned on the already acquired experimental data. Having such posterior models can then provide estimators of epistemic uncertainty and information gain that can drive an experimental design policy. Altogether, here we will argue that GFlowNets can become a valuable tool for AI-driven scientific discovery, especially in scenarios of very large candidate spaces where we have access to cheap but inaccurate measurements or to expensive but accurate measurements. This is a common setting in the context of drug and material discovery, which we use as examples throughout the paper."}}

A key limitation of GFlowNets until this time has been that they are restricted to discrete spaces. We present a theory for generalized GFlowNets, which encompasses both existing discrete GFlowNets and ones with continuous or hybrid state spaces, and perform experiments with two goals in mind. First, we illustrate critical points of the theory and the importance of various assumptions. Second, we empirically demonstrate how observations about discrete GFlowNets transfer to the continuous case and show strong results compared to non-GFlowNet baselines on several previously studied tasks. This work greatly widens the perspectives for the application of GFlowNets in probabilistic inference and various modeling settings."}}

These experiments can consist of multiple stages, with increasing levels of precision and cost of evaluation, where candidates are filtered. This makes the diversity of proposed candidates a key consideration in the ideation phase. In this work, we propose an active learning algorithm leveraging epistemic uncertainty estimation and the recently proposed GFlowNets as a generator of diverse candidate solutions, with the objective to obtain a diverse batch of useful (as defined by some utility function, for example, the predicted anti-microbial activity of a peptide) and informative candidates after each round. We also propose a scheme to incorporate existing labeled datasets of candidates, in addition to a reward function, to speed up learning in GFlowNets. We present empirical results on several biological sequence design tasks, and we find that our method generates more diverse and novel batches with high scoring candidates compared to existing approaches."}}

MOGFNs consist of a Conditional GFlowNet which models a family of single-objective sub-problems derived by decomposing the multi-objective optimization problem.

Catalyst materials play a crucial role in the electrochemical reactions involved in this transition, such as electrofuel synthesis, renewable fertiliser production and energy storage. In this context, there is a need to discover more effective catalysts for these reactions. Machine learning (ML) holds the potential to efficiently model the properties of materials from large amounts of data, and thus to accelerate electrocatalyst design. The Open Catalyst Project OC20 data set was constructed to that end. However, most existing ML models trained on it are still neither scalable nor accurate enough for practical applications. Here, we propose several task-specific innovations, applicable to most architectures, which increase both computational efficiency and precision. In particular, we aim to improve (1) the graph creation step, (2) atom representations and (3) the energy prediction head. We describe and evaluate these contributions across several architectures, showing up to 5$\\times$ reduction in inference time without sacrificing accuracy."}}

Relevant criteria may be, for example, the presence of specific folding motifs, binding to molecular ligands, sensing properties, etc. Most practical approaches to aptamer design identify a small set of promising candidate sequences using high-throughput experiments (e.g. SELEX), and then optimize performance by introducing only minor modifications to the empirically found candidates. Sequences that possess the desired properties but differ drastically in chemical composition will add diversity to the search space and facilitate the discovery of useful nucleic acid aptamers. Systematic diversification protocols are needed. Here we propose to use an unsupervised machine learning model known as the Potts model to discover new, useful sequences with controllable sequence diversity. We start by training a Potts model using the maximum entropy principle on a small set of empirically identified sequences unified by a common feature. To generate new candidate sequences with a controllable degree of diversity, we take advantage of the model's spectral feature: an energy bandgap separating sequences that are similar to the training set from those that are distinct. By controlling the Potts energy range that is sampled, we generate sequences that are distinct from the training set yet still likely to have the encoded features. To demonstrate performance, we apply our approach to design diverse pools of sequences with specified secondary structure motifs in 30-mer RNA and DNA aptamers."}}
