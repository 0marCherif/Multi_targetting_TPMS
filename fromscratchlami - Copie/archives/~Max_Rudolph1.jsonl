However, existing approaches often overlook the challenge of generalizing learned policies to teams of new compositions, sizes, and robots. While such generalization might not be important in teams of virtual agents that can retrain policies on-demand, it is pivotal in multi-robot systems that are deployed in the real-world and must readily adapt to inevitable changes. As such, multi-robot policies must remain robust to team changes -- an ability we call adaptive teaming. In this work, we investigate if awareness and communication of robot capabilities can provide such generalization by conducting detailed experiments involving an established multi-robot test bed. We demonstrate that shared decentralized policies, that enable robots to be both aware of and communicate their capabilities, can achieve adaptive teaming by implicitly capturing the fundamental relationship between collective capabilities and effective coordination.

Common coverage control techniques are targeted towards homogeneous teams of robots and do not consider what happens when the sensing capabilities of the robots are vastly different. This work proposes an extension to Lloyd's algorithm that fuses coverage information from heterogeneous robots with differing sensing capabilities to effectively observe a domain. Namely, we study a bimodal team of robots consisting of aerial and ground agents. In our problem formulation we use aerial robots with coarse domain sensors to approximate the number of ground robots needed within their sensing region to effectively cover it. This information is relayed to ground robots, who perform an extension to the Lloyd's algorithm that balances a locally focused coverage controller with a globally focused distribution controller. The stability of the Lloyd's algorithm extension is proven and its performance is evaluated through simulation and experiments using the Robotarium, a remotely-accessible, multi-robot testbed."}}

We challenge this assumption and present a contrary hypothesis -- sim2real transfer of robots may be improved with lower (not higher) fidelity simulation. We conduct a systematic large-scale evaluation of this hypothesis on the problem of visual navigation -- in the real world, and on 2 different simulators (Habitat and iGibson) using 3 different robots (A1, AlienGo, Spot). Our results show that, contrary to expectation, adding fidelity does not help with learning; performance is poor due to slow simulation speed (preventing large-scale learning) and overfitting to inaccuracies in simulation physics. Instead, building simple models of the robot motion using real-world data can improve learning and generalization."}}

MRTA problems are known to be challenging when tasks require multiple robots and the team is composed of heterogeneous robots. These challenges are further exacerbated when we need to account for uncertainties encountered in the real-world. In this work, we address coalition formation in heterogeneous multi-robot teams with uncertain capabilities. We specifically focus on tasks that require coalitions to collectively satisfy certain minimum requirements. Existing approaches to uncertainty-aware task allocation either maximize expected pay-off (risk-neutral approaches) or improve worst-case or near-worst-case outcomes (risk-averse approaches). Within the context of our problem, we demonstrate the inherent limitations of unilaterally ignoring or avoiding risk and show that these approaches can in fact reduce the probability of satisfying task requirements. Inspired by models that explain foraging behaviors in animals, we develop a risk-adaptive approach to task allocation. Our approach adaptively switches between risk-averse and risk-seeking behavior in order to maximize the probability of satisfying task requirements. Comprehensive numerical experiments conclusively demonstrate that our risk-adaptive approach outperforms risk-neutral and risk-averse approaches. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a simulated multi-robot emergency response scenario."}}
