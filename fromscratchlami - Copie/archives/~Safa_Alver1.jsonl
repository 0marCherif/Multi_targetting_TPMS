A Performance Comparison of Decision-Time vs. Background Planning", "abstract": "In model-based reinforcement learning, an agent can leverage a learned model to improve its way of behaving in different ways. Two prevalent approaches are decision-time planning and background planning. In this study, we are interested in understanding under what conditions and in which settings one of these two planning styles will perform better than the other in domains that require fast responses. After viewing them through the lens of dynamic programming, we first consider the classical instantiations of these planning styles and provide theoretical results and hypotheses on which one will perform better in the pure planning, planning & learning, and transfer learning settings. We then consider the modern instantiations of these planning styles and provide hypotheses on which one will perform better in the last two of the considered settings. Lastly, we perform several illustrative experiments to empirically validate both our theoretical results and hypotheses. Overall, our findings suggest that even though decision-time planning does not perform as well as background planning in their classical instantiations, in their modern instantiations, it can perform on par or better than background planning in both the planning & learning and transfer learning settings."}}

However, the common practice in model-based reinforcement learning is to learn models that model every aspect of the agent's environment, regardless of whether they are important in coming up with optimal decisions or not. In this paper, we argue that such models are not particularly well-suited for performing scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios and we propose new kinds of models that only model the relevant aspects of the environment, which we call minimal value-equivalent partial models. After providing the formal definitions of these models, we provide theoretical results demonstrating the scalability advantages of performing planning with minimal value-equivalent partial models and then perform experiments to empirically illustrate our theoretical results. Finally, we provide some useful heuristics on how to learn such models with deep learning architectures and empirically demonstrate that models learned in such a way can allow for performing planning that is robust to distribution shifts and compounding model errors. Overall, both our theoretical and empirical results suggest that minimal value-equivalent partial models can provide significant benefits to performing scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios.

Specifically, we consider the framework of generalized policy evaluation and improvement, in which the rewards for all tasks of interest are assumed to be expressible as a linear combination of a fixed set of features. We show theoretically that, under certain assumptions, having access to a specific set of diverse policies, which we call a set of independent policies, can allow for instantaneously achieving high-level performance on all possible downstream tasks which are typically more complex than the ones on which the agent was trained. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose a simple algorithm that iteratively constructs this set of policies. In addition to empirically validating our theoretical results, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set construction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to build a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible downstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of independent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream tasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination of the features. Finally, we demonstrate how this policy set can be useful in a lifelong reinforcement learning setting."}}

After being trained on a pre-specified task distribution, the learned weights of the agent's RNN are said to implement an efficient learning algorithm through their activity dynamics, which allows the agent to quickly solve new tasks sampled from the same distribution. However, due to the black-box nature of these agents, the way in which they work is not yet fully understood. In this study, we shed light on the internal working mechanisms of these agents by reformulating the meta-RL problem using the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. We hypothesize that the learned activity dynamics is acting as belief states for such agents. Several illustrative experiments suggest that this hypothesis is true, and that recurrent meta-RL agents can be viewed as agents that learn to act optimally in partially observable environments consisting of multiple related tasks. This view helps in understanding their failure cases and some interesting model-based results reported in the literature."}}
