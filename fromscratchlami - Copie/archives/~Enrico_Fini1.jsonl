In a nutshell, UCDis operated by introducing a novel distillation loss that takes into account all the images in a mini-batch, enforcing similarity between features associated to all the pixels from the same classes, and pulling apart those corresponding to pixels from different classes. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we contrast features of the new model with features extracted by a frozen model learned at the previous incremental step. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed distillation technique, which can be used in synergy with previous IL approaches, and leads to state-of-art performance on three commonly adopted benchmarks for incremental semantic segmentation."}}

However, despite their success, most prompt learning techniques tend to underperform in the presence of domain shift. Our study addresses this problem and, to improve CLIP's generalization ability across domains, proposes \\textsc{StyLIP}, a novel approach for Domain Generalization (DG) based on a domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy. In the absence of explicit domain knowledge, we aim to disentangle the visual style and the content information extracted from the pre-trained CLIP in the prompts so they can be effortlessly adapted to novel domains during inference. Furthermore, we consider a set of style projectors to learn the prompt tokens directly from these multi-scale style features, and the generated prompt embeddings are later fused with the multi-scale visual features learned through a content projector. The projectors are contrastively trained, given CLIP's frozen vision and text encoders. We present extensive experiments in five different DG settings on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that \\textsc{StyLIP} consistently outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art methods."}}

In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose an approach for continual semi-supervised learning--a setting where not all the data samples are labeled. A primary issue in this scenario is the model forgetting representations of unlabeled data and overfitting the labeled samples. We leverage the power of nearest-neighbor classifiers to nonlinearly partition the feature space and flexibly model the underlying data distribution thanks to its non-parametric nature. This enables the model to learn a strong representation for the current task, and distill relevant information from previous tasks. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation and show that our method outperforms all the existing approaches by large margins, setting a solid state of the art on the continual semi-supervised learning paradigm. For example, on CIFAR-100 we surpass several others even when using at least 30 times less supervision (0.8% vs. 25% of annotations). Finally, our method works well on both low and high resolution images and scales seamlessly to more complex datasets such as ImageNet-100.

However, deep architectures trained with gradient-based techniques suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which is the tendency to forget previously learned knowledge while learning new tasks. Aiming at devising strategies to counteract this effect, incremental learning approaches have gained popularity over the past years. However, the first incremental learning methods for semantic segmentation appeared only recently. While effective, these approaches do not account for a crucial aspect in pixel-level dense prediction problems, i.e. the role of attention mechanisms. To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce a novel attentive feature distillation approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while accounting for semantic spatial- and channel-level dependencies. Furthermore, we propose a {continual attentive fusion} structure, which takes advantage of the attention learned from the new and the old tasks while learning features for the new task. Finally, we also introduce a novel strategy to account for the background class in the distillation loss, thus preventing biased predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K, setting a new state of the art."}}

With an increase in available modalities, automatic understanding of emotions is being performed more accurately. The success in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER), primarily relies on the supervised learning paradigm. However, data annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and as emotion expression and perception depends on several factors (e.g., age, gender, culture) obtaining labels with a high reliability is hard. Motivated by these, we focus on unsupervised feature learning for MER. We consider discrete emotions, and as modalities text, audio and vision are used. Our method, as being based on contrastive loss between pairwise modalities, is the first attempt in MER literature. Our end-to-end feature learning approach has several differences (and advantages) compared to existing MER methods: i) it is unsupervised, so the learning is lack of data labelling cost; ii) it does not require data spatial augmentation, modality alignment, large number of batch size or epochs; iii) it applies data fusion only at inference; and iv) it does not require backbones pre-trained on emotion recognition task. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms several baseline approaches and unsupervised learning methods applied in MER. Particularly, it even surpasses a few supervised MER state-of-the-art."}}
