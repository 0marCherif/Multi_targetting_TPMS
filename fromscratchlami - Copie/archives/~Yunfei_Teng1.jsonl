The training data is non-stationary and the non-stationarity is imposed by a sequence of distinct tasks. We first analyze a deep model trained on only one learning task in isolation and identify a region in network parameter space, where the model performance is close to the recovered optimum. We provide empirical evidence that this region resembles a cone that expands along the convergence direction. We study the principal directions of the trajectory of the optimizer after convergence and show that traveling along a few top principal directions can quickly bring the parameters outside the cone but this is not the case for the remaining directions. We argue that catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning setting can be alleviated when the parameters are constrained to stay within the intersection of the plausible cones of individual tasks that were so far encountered during training. Based on this observation we present our direction-constrained optimization (DCO) method, where for each task we introduce a linear autoencoder to approximate its corresponding top forbidden principal directions. They are then incorporated into the loss function in the form of a regularization term for the purpose of learning the coming tasks without forgetting. Furthermore, in order to control the memory growth as the number of tasks increases, we propose a memory-efficient version of our algorithm called compressed DCO (DCO-COMP) that allocates a memory of fixed size for storing all autoencoders. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm performs favorably compared to other state-of-art regularization-based continual learning methods. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/yunfei-teng/DCO ."}}

In this paper we develop an algorithm that realizes the learning rate drop $\\textit{automatically}$. The proposed method, that we refer to as AutoDrop, is motivated by the observation that the angular velocity of the model parameters, i.e., the velocity of the changes of the convergence direction, for a fixed learning rate initially increases rapidly and then progresses towards soft saturation. At saturation the optimizer slows down thus the angular velocity saturation is a good indicator for dropping the learning rate. After the drop, the angular velocity ``resets'' and follows the previously described pattern - it increases again until saturation. We show that our method improves over SOTA training approaches: it accelerates the training of DL models and leads to a better generalization. We also show that our method does not require any extra hyperparameter tuning. AutoDrop is furthermore extremely simple to implement and computationally cheap. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing our algorithm and provide convergence guarantees. "}}

We propose a new algorithm, whose parameter updates rely on two forces: a regular gradient step, and a corrective direction dictated by the currently best-performing worker (leader). Our method differs from the parameter-averaging scheme EASGD in a number of ways: (i) our objective formulation does not change the location of stationary points compared to the original optimization problem; (ii) we avoid convergence decelerations caused by pulling local workers descending to different local minima to each other (i.e. to the average of their parameters); (iii) our update by design breaks the curse of symmetry (the phenomenon of being trapped in poorly generalizing sub-optimal solutions in symmetric non-convex landscapes); and (iv) our approach is more communication efficient since it broadcasts only parameters of the leader rather than all workers. We provide theoretical analysis of the batch version of the proposed algorithm, which we call Leader Gradient Descent (LGD), and its stochastic variant (LSGD). Finally, we implement an asynchronous version of our algorithm and extend it to the multi-leader setting, where we form groups of workers, each represented by its own local leader (the best performer in a group), and update each worker with a corrective direction comprised of two attractive forces: one to the local, and one to the global leader (the best performer among all workers). The multi-leader setting is well-aligned with current hardware architecture, where local workers forming a group lie within a single computational node and different groups correspond to different nodes. For training convolutional neural networks, we empirically demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines."}}
