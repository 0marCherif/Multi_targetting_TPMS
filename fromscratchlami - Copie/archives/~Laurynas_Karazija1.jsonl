As a result, in recent years, open-vocabulary methods have attracted the interest of the community. This paper proposes a new method for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. Prior work largely relies on contrastive training using image-text pairs, leveraging grouping mechanisms to learn image features that are both aligned with language and well-localised. This however can introduce ambiguity as the visual appearance of images with similar captions often varies. Instead, we leverage the generative properties of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to sample a set of support images for a given textual category. This provides a distribution of appearances for a given text circumventing the ambiguity problem. We further propose a mechanism that considers the contextual background of the sampled images to better localise objects and segment the background directly. We show that our method can be used to ground several existing pre-trained self-supervised feature extractors in natural language and provide explainable predictions by mapping back to regions in the support set. Our proposal is training-free, relying on pre-trained components only, yet, shows strong performance on a range of open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks, obtaining a lead of more than 10% on the Pascal VOC benchmark."}}

However, compared to using appearance, it has some blind spots, such as the fact that objects become invisible if they do not move. In this work, we propose an approach that combines the strengths of motion-based and appearance-based segmentation. We propose to supervise an image segmentation network, tasking it with predicting regions that are likely to contain simple motion patterns, and thus likely to correspond to objects. We apply this network in two modes. In the unsupervised video segmentation mode, the network is trained on a collection of unlabelled videos, using the learning process itself as an algorithm to segment these videos. In the unsupervised image segmentation model, the network is learned using videos and applied to segment independent still images. With this, we obtain strong empirical results in unsupervised video and image segmentation, significantly outperforming the state of the art on benchmarks such as DAVIS, sometimes with a  IoU gap."}}

The method can extract objects form still images, but uses videos for supervision. While prior works have considered motion for segmentation, a key insight is that, while motion can be used to identify objects, not all objects are necessarily in motion: the absence of motion does not imply the absence of objects. Hence, our model learns to predict image regions that are likely to contain motion patterns characteristic of objects moving rigidly. It does not predict specific motion, which cannot be done unambiguously from a still image, but a distribution of possible motions, which includes the possibility that an object does not move at all. We demonstrate the advantage of this approach over its deterministic counterpart and show state-of-the-art unsupervised object segmentation performance on simulated and real-world benchmarks, surpassing methods that use motion even at test time. As our approach is applicable to variety of network architectures that segment the scenes, we also apply it to existing image reconstruction-based models showing drastic improvement.

As the model only uses a single image as input, we can apply it in two settings: unsupervised video segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results for videos, and demonstrate the viability of our approach on still images containing novel objects. Additionally we experiment with different motion models and optical flow backbones and find the method to be robust to these change.

Two approaches for building X-CNNs are presented. The base approach learns the topology in a data-driven manner, by using measurements performed on the base CNN and supplied data. The iterative approach performs further optimisation of the topology through a combined learning procedure, simultaneously learning the topology and training the network. The approaches were evaluated agains examples of hand-designed X-CNNs and their base variants, showing superior performance and, in some cases, gaining an additional 9% of accuracy. From further considerations, we conclude that the presented methodology takes less time than any manual approach would, whilst also significantly reducing the design complexity. The application of the methods is fully automated and implemented in Xsertion library (Code is publicly available at https://github.com/karazijal/xsertion )."}}

We focus on predicting whether a user will successfully achieve his/her weight objective. For this, we design several deep long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, including a novel cross-modal LSTM (X-LSTM), and demonstrate their superiority over baseline approaches. The X-LSTM improves parameter efficiency by processing each modality separately and allowing for information flow between them by way of recurrent cross-connections. We present a general hyperparameter optimisation technique for X-LSTMs, which allows us to significantly improve on the LSTM and a prior state-of-the-art cross-modal approach, using a comparable number of parameters. Finally, we visualise the model's predictions, revealing implications about latent variables in this task."}}
