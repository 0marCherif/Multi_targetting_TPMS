There exists a theoretical subsampling of markers that is able to recreate the same information as a full panel; therefore, removing the self-correlating information with such a subset would increase the efficiency of the imaging process and maximize the information collected. By selecting an idealized subsample of markers, a deep learning model can be trained to predict the same information as a full dataset with fewer rounds of staining. Here we evaluate several methods of subsample marker selection and demonstrate their ability to reconstruct the full panel\u2019s information."}}

This will be realized based on advances in high performance computing, computational modeling, and an expanding repertoire of observational data across multiple scales and modalities. In 2020, the US National Cancer Institute, and the US Department of Energy, through a trans-disciplinary research community at the intersection of advanced computing and cancer research, initiated team science collaborative projects to explore the development and implementation of predictive Cancer Patient Digital Twins. Several diverse pilot projects were launched to provide key insights into important features of this emerging landscape and to determine the requirements for the development and adoption of cancer patient digital twins. Projects included exploring approaches to using a large cohort of digital twins to perform deep phenotyping and plan treatments at the individual level, prototyping self-learning digital twin platforms, using adaptive digital twin approaches to monitor treatment response and resistance, developing methods to integrate and fuse data and observations across multiple scales, and personalizing treatment based on cancer type. Collectively these efforts have yielded increased insights into the opportunities and challenges facing cancer patient digital twin approaches and helped define a pa..."}}
