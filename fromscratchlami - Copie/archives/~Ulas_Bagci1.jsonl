While over half of patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at a distant stage, patients who are diagnosed early enjoy a much higher 5-year survival rate of 34% compared to 3% in the former; hence, early diagnosis is key. Unique challenges in the medical imaging domain such as extremely limited annotated data sets and typically large 3D volumetric data have made it difficult for deep learning to secure a strong foothold. In this work, we construct two novel \u201cinflated\u201d deep network architectures, InceptINN and DenseINN, for the task of diagnosing IPMN from multisequence (T1 and T2) MRI. These networks inflate their 2D layers to 3D and bootstrap weights from their 2D counterparts (Inceptionv3 and DenseNet121 respectively) trained on ImageNet to the new 3D kernels. We also extend the inflation process by further expanding the pre-trained kernels to handle any number of input modalities and different fusion strategies. This is one of the first studies to train an end-to-end deep network on multisequence MRI for IPMN diagnosis, and shows that our proposed novel inflated network architectures are able to handle the extremely limited training data (139 MRI scans), while providing an absolute improvement of 8.768.76% in accuracy for diagnosing IPMN over the current state-of-the-art.

Current clinical standards require the resection and histopathological analysis of polyps due to test accuracy and sensitivity of optical biopsy methods falling substantially below recommended levels. In this study, we design a novel capsule network architecture (D-Caps) to improve the viability of optical biopsy of colorectal polyps. Our proposed method introduces several technical novelties including a novel capsule architecture with a capsule-average pooling (CAP) method to improve efficiency in large-scale image classification. We demonstrate improved results over the previous state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) approach by as much as 43%. This work provides an important benchmark on the new Mayo Polyp dataset, a significantly more challenging and larger dataset than previous polyp studies, with results stratified across all available categories, imaging devices and modalities, and focus modes to promote future direction into AI-driven colorectal cancer screening systems.

Towards solving this deficiency, we teach a novel multi-task capsule network to improve the explainability of predictions by embodying the same high-level language used by human-experts. Our explainable capsule network, X-Caps, encodes high-level visual object attributes within the vectors of its capsules, then forms predictions based solely on these human-interpretable features. To encode attributes, X-Caps utilizes a new routing sigmoid function to independently route information from child capsules to parents. Further, to provide radiologists with an estimate of model confidence, we train our network on a distribution of expert labels, modeling inter-observer agreement and punishing over/under confidence during training, supervised by human-experts\u2019 agreement. X-Caps simultaneously learns attribute and malignancy scores from a multi-center dataset of over 1000 CT scans of lung cancer screening patients. We demonstrate a simple 2D capsule network can outperform a state-of-the-art deep dense dual-path 3D CNN at capturing visually-interpretable high-level attributes and malignancy prediction, while providing malignancy prediction scores approaching that of non-explainable 3D CNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate capsule networks for making predictions based on radiologist-level interpretable attributes and its applications to medical image diagnosis.

However, the procedure experiences high miss rates due to polyp heterogeneity and inter-observer dependency. Hence, several deep learning powered systems have been proposed considering the criticality of polyp detection and segmentation in clinical practices. Despite achieving improved outcomes, the existing automated approaches are inefficient in attaining real-time processing speed. Moreover, they suffer from a significant performance drop when evaluated on inter-patient data, especially those collected from different centers. Therefore, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep learning based architecture, Transformer based Residual network (TransNetR), for colon polyp segmentation and evaluate its diagnostic performance. The proposed architecture, TransNetR, is an encoder-decoder network that consists of a pre-trained ResNet50 as the encoder, three decoder blocks, and an upsampling layer at the end of the network. TransNetR obtains a high dice coefficient of 0.8706 and a mean Intersection over union of 0.8016 and retains a real-time processing speed of 54.60 on the Kvasir-SEG dataset. Apart from this,  the major contribution of the work lies in exploring the generalizability of the TransNetR by testing the proposed algorithm on the out-of-distribution (test distribution is unknown and different from training distribution) dataset. As a use case, we tested our proposed algorithm on the PolypGen (6 unique centers) dataset and two other popular polyp segmentation benchmarking datasets. We obtained state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets during out-of-distribution testing. The source code of TransNetR is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/DebeshJha/TransNetR}."}}

Despite this, their success has been mostly limited to small-scale classification datasets due to their computationally expensive nature. Recent studies have partially overcome this burden by locally-constraining the dynamic routing of features with convolutional capsules. Though memory efficient, convolutional capsules impose geometric constraints which fundamentally limit the ability of capsules to model the pose/deformation of objects. Further, they do not address the bigger memory concern of class-capsules scaling-up to bigger tasks such as detection or large-scale classification. In this study, we introduce deformable capsules (DeformCaps), a new capsule structure (SplitCaps), and a novel dynamic routing algorithm (SE-Routing) to balance computational efficiency with the need for modeling a large number of objects and classes. We demonstrate that the proposed methods allow capsules to efficiently scale-up to large-scale computer vision tasks for the first time, and create the first-ever capsule network for object detection in the literature. Our proposed architecture is a one-stage detection framework and obtains results on MS COCO which are on-par with state-of-the-art one-stage CNN-based methods, while producing fewer false positive detections."}}

A new architecture recently introduced by Sabour et al., referred to as a capsule networks with dynamic routing, has shown great initial results for digit recognition and small image classification. The success of capsule networks lies in their ability to preserve more information about the input by replacing max-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for preservation of part-whole relationships in the data. This preservation of the input is demonstrated by reconstructing the input from the output capsule vectors. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object segmentation for the first time in the literature. We extend the idea of convolutional capsules with locally-connected routing and propose the concept of deconvolutional capsules. Further, we extend the masked reconstruction to reconstruct the positive input class. The proposed convolutional-deconvolutional capsule network, called SegCaps, shows strong results for the task of object segmentation with substantial decrease in parameter space. As an example application, we applied the proposed SegCaps to segment pathological lungs from low dose CT scans and compared its accuracy and efficiency with other U-Net-based architectures.  SegCaps is able to handle large image sizes (512 x 512) as opposed to baseline capsules (typically less than 32 x 32). The proposed SegCaps reduced the number of parameters of U-Net architecture by 95.4% while still providing a better segmentation accuracy. "}}
