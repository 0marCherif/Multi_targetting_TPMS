Conversely, existing sub-quadratic NP variants perform significantly worse than that of TNPs. Tackling this issue, we propose Efficient Queries Transformer Neural Processes (EQTNPs), a more computationally efficient NP variant. The model encodes the context dataset into a set of vectors that is linear in the number of context datapoints. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the context vectors. We empirically show that EQTNPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art."}}

Conversely, existing sub-quadratic NP variants perform significantly worse than that of TNPs. Tackling this issue, we propose Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes (LBANPs), a new computationally efficient sub-quadratic NP variant, that has a querying computational complexity independent of the number of context datapoints. The model encodes the context dataset into a constant number of latent vectors on which self-attention is performed. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the latent vectors. We empirically show that LBANPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art on meta-regression, image completion, and contextual multi-armed bandits. We demonstrate that LBANPs can trade-off the computational cost and performance according to the number of latent vectors. Finally, we show LBANPs can scale beyond existing attention-based NP variants to larger dataset settings."}}

Recent state-of-the-art selective methods come with architectural changes either via introducing a separate selection head or an extra abstention logit. In this paper, we challenge the aforementioned methods. The results suggest that the superior performance of state-of-the-art methods is owed to training a more generalizable classifier rather than their proposed selection mechanisms. We argue that the best performing selection mechanism should instead be rooted in the classifier itself. Our proposed selection strategy uses the classification scores and achieves better results by a significant margin, consistently, across all coverages and all datasets, without any added compute cost. Furthermore, inspired by semi-supervised learning, we propose an entropy-based regularizer that improves the performance of selective classification methods. Our proposed selection mechanism with the proposed entropy-based regularizer achieves new state-of-the-art results."}}

The framework includes a permutation invariant tree generation model which forms the backbone of graph generation. Tree nodes are supernodes, each representing a cluster of nodes in the graph. Graph nodes and edges are incrementally generated inside the clusters by traversing the tree supernodes, respecting the structure of the tree decomposition, and following node sharing decisions between the clusters. Further, we discuss the shortcomings of the standard evaluation criteria based on statistical properties of the generated graphs. We propose to compare the generalizability of models based on expected likelihood. Empirical results on a variety of standard graph generation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method."}}

Specifically, we present two sets of contributions. In the first part of the paper, we show that different choices of penalties define the regions of the input space where the property is observed. As such, previous methods result in models that are monotonic only in a small volume of the input space. We thus propose an approach that uses mixtures of training instances and random points to populate the space and enforce the penalty in a much larger region. As a second set of contributions, we introduce regularization strategies that enforce other notions of monotonicity in different settings. In this case, we consider applications, such as image classification and generative modeling, where monotonicity is not a hard constraint but can help improve some aspects of the model. Namely, we show that inducing monotonicity can be beneficial in applications such as: (1) allowing for controllable data generation, (2) defining strategies to detect anomalous data, and (3) generating explanations for predictions. Our proposed approaches do not introduce relevant computational overhead while leading to efficient procedures that provide extra benefits over baseline models."}}

The proposed approach focuses on the setting where point-wise gradient penalties are used as a soft constraint alongside the empirical risk during training. Our results indicate that the choice of the points employed for computing such a penalty defines the regions of the input space where the desired property is satisfied. As such, previous methods result in models that are monotonic either only at the boundaries of the input space or in the small volume where training data lies. Given this, we propose an alternative approach that uses pairs of training instances and random points to create mixtures of points that lie inside and outside of the convex hull of the training sample. Empirical evaluation carried out using different datasets show that the proposed approach yields predictors that are monotonic in a larger volume of the space compared to previous methods. Our approach does not introduce relevant computational overhead leading to an efficient procedure that consistently achieves the best performance amongst all alternatives."}}

Meanwhile, heterogeneous data are often associated with missingness in real-world applications due to heterogeneity and noise of input sources. In this work, we propose the variational selective autoencoder (VSAE), a general framework to learn representations from partially-observed heterogeneous data. VSAE learns the latent dependencies in heterogeneous data by modeling the joint distribution of observed data, unobserved data, and the imputation mask which represents how the data are missing. It results in a unified model for various downstream tasks including data generation and imputation. Evaluation on both low-dimensional and high-dimensional heterogeneous datasets for these two tasks shows improvement over state-of-the-art models."}}

It uses the gradients in back-propagation as weights (grad-weights) to explain network decisions. However, applying Grad-CAM to embedding networks raises significant challenges because embedding networks are trained by millions of dynamically paired examples (e.g. triplets). To overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptation of the Grad-CAM method for embedding networks. First, we aggregate grad-weights from multiple training examples to improve the stability of Grad-CAM. Then, we develop an efficient weight-transfer method to explain decisions for any image without back-propagation. We extensively validate the method on the standard CUB200 dataset in which our method produces more accurate visual attention than the original Grad-CAM method. We also apply the method to a house price estimation application using images. The method produces convincing qualitative results, showcasing the practicality of our approach."}}
