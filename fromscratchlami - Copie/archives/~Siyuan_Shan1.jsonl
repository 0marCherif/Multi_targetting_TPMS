Active feature acquisition (AFA), where features are sequentially acquired to improve the prediction, is a step towards this goal. However, current AFA methods lack robustness in two key areas that limits their applicability in the real world. First, current AFA models only consider a small set of candidate features and have difficulty scaling to a large feature space. Second, they are ignorant about the valid domains where they can predict confidently, thus they can be vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In order to remedy these deficiencies and bring AFA models closer to practical use, we propose several techniques to advance the current AFA approaches. Our framework can easily handle a large number of features using a hierarchical acquisition policy and is more robust to OOD inputs with the help of an OOD detector for partially observed data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework over strong baselines."}}

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks."}}

In this work, we step forward in this direction and propose a semi-parametric method, Meta-Neighborhoods, where predictions are made adaptively to the neighborhood of the input. We show that Meta-Neighborhoods is a generalization of k-nearest-neighbors. Due to the simpler manifold structure around a local neighborhood, Meta-Neighborhoods represent the predictive distribution p(y | x) more accurately. To reduce memory and computation overheads, we propose induced neighborhoods that summarize the training data into a much smaller dictionary. A meta-learning based training mechanism is then exploited to jointly learn the induced neighborhoods and the model. Extensive studies demonstrate the superiority of our method."}}

The visualization of CNNs proves that different CNN models can capture distinctive features of characters. Abstract In this paper, we propose an innovative end-to-end subtitle detection and recognition system for videos in East Asian languages. Our end-to-end system consists of multiple stages. Subtitles are firstly detected by a novel image operator based on the sequence information of consecutive video frames. Then, an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on synthetic data is adopted for detecting and recognizing East Asian characters. Finally, a dynamic programming approach leveraging language models is applied to constitute results of the entire body of text lines. The proposed system achieves average end-to-end accuracies of 98.2% and 98.3% on 40 videos in Simplified Chinese and 40 videos in Traditional Chinese respectively, which is a significant outperformance of other existing methods. The near-perfect accuracy of our system dramatically narrows the gap between human cognitive ability and state-of-the-art algorithms used for such a task."}}

The contributions of our algorithm are threefold: (1) We transplant traditional image registration algorithms to an end-to-end convolutional neural network framework, while maintaining the unsupervised nature of image registration problems. The image-to-image integrated framework can simultaneously learn both image features and transformation matrix for registration. (2) Training with additional data without any label can further improve the registration performance by approximately 10 %. (3) The registration speed is 100x faster than traditional methods. The proposed network is easy to implement and can be trained efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art results on 2D brain registration and achieves comparable results on 2D liver registration. It can be extended to register other organs beyond liver and brain such as kidney, lung, and heart."}}
