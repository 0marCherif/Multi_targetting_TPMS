However, such a seemingly common skill introduces a lot of challenges for robots to achieve: The robots need to operate such dynamic actions at high-speed, collaborate precisely, and interact with diverse objects. In this paper, we design a system with two multi-finger hands attached to robot arms to solve this problem. We train our system using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer to deploy on the real robots. To overcome the Sim2Real gap, we provide multiple novel algorithm designs including learning a trajectory prediction model for the object. Such a model can help the robot catcher has a real-time estimation of where the object will be heading, and then react accordingly. We conduct our experiments with multiple objects in the real-world system, and show significant improvements over multiple baselines.

With continuous time inputs, the model can generate a continuous and smooth grasping plan. We name the proposed model Continuous Grasping Function (CGF). CGF is learned via generative modeling with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder using 3D human demonstrations. We will first convert the large-scale human-object interaction trajectories to robot demonstrations via motion retargeting, and then use these demonstrations to train CGF. During inference, we perform sampling with CGF to generate different grasping plans in the simulator and select the successful ones to transfer to the real robot. By training on diverse human data, our CGF allows generalization to manipulate multiple objects. Compared to previous planning algorithms, CGF is more efficient and achieves significant improvement on success rate when transferred to grasping with the real Allegro Hand."}}

It reveals useful contact information that may not be inferred directly from vision. In fact, humans can even perform in-hand dexterous manipulation without using vision. Can we enable the same ability for the multi-finger robot hand? In this paper, we present Touch Dexterity, a new system that can perform in-hand object rotation using only touching without seeing the object. Instead of relying on precise tactile sensing in a small region, we introduce a new system design using dense binary force sensors (touch or no touch) overlaying one side of the whole robot hand (palm, finger links, fingertips). Such a design is low-cost, giving a larger coverage of the object, and minimizing the Sim2Real gap at the same time. We train an in-hand rotation policy using Reinforcement Learning on diverse objects in simulation. Relying on touch-only sensing, we can directly deploy the policy in a real robot hand and rotate novel objects that are not presented in training. Extensive ablations are performed on how tactile information help in-hand manipulation.Our project is available at https://touchdexterity.github.io."}}

We introduce a novel single-camera teleoperation system to collect the 3D demonstrations efficiently with only an iPad and a computer. One key contribution of our system is that we construct a customized robot hand for each user in the physical simulator, which is a manipulator resembling the same kinematics structure and shape of the operator's hand. This provides an intuitive interface and avoid unstable human-robot hand retargeting for data collection, leading to large-scale and high quality data. Once the data is collected, the customized robot hand trajectories can be converted to different specified robot hands (models that are manufactured) to generate training demonstrations. With imitation learning using our data, we show large improvement over baselines with multiple complex manipulation tasks. Importantly, we show our learned policy is significantly more robust when transferring to the real robot. More videos can be found in the https://yzqin.github.io/dex-teleop-imitation ."}}

The benchmark focuses on the object rearrangement problem, specifically table organization tasks. We provide a set of identical real robot setups and facilitate remote experiments of standardized table organization scenarios in varying difficulties. In this workflow, users upload their solutions to our remote server and their code is executed on the real robot setups and scored automatically. After each execution, the OCRTOC team resets the experimental setup manually. We also provide a simulation environment that researchers can use to develop and test their solutions. With the OCRTOC benchmark, we aim to lower the barrier of conducting reproducible research on robotic grasping and manipulation and accelerate progress in this field. Executing standardized scenarios on identical real robot setups allows us to quantify algorithm performances and achieve fair comparisons. Using this benchmark we held a competition in the 2020 International Conference on Intelligence Robots and Systems (IROS 2020). In total, 59 teams took part in this competition worldwide. We present the results and our observations of the 2020 competition, and discuss our adjustments and improvements for the upcoming OCRTOC 2021 competition.
