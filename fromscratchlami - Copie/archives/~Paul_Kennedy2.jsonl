However, due to the irregular shapes of nodules, and the low-intensity contrast between the nodules and other lung areas, precisely segmenting nodules from lung CT images is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a highly effective and robust solution to this problem by innovatively utilizing the changes of nodule shapes over continuous slices (inter-slice changes) and develop a deep learning based end-to-end system. Different from the existing 2.5D or 3D methods that attempt to explore the inter-slice features, we propose to create a novel synthetic image to depict the unique changing pattern of nodules between slices in distinctive colour patterns. Based on the new synthetic images, we then adopt the deep learning based image segmentation techniques and develop a modified U-Net architecture to learn the unique color patterns formed by nodules. With our proposed approach, the detection and segmentation of nodules can be achieved simultaneously with an accuracy significantly higher than the state of the arts by 10% without introducing high computation cost. By taking advantage of inter-slice information and form the proposed synthetic image, the task of lung nodule segmentation is done more accurately and effectively."}}

Abstract Methods for document clustering and topic modelling in online social networks (OSNs) offer a means of categorising, annotating and making sense of large volumes of user generated content. Many techniques have been developed over the years, ranging from text mining and clustering methods to latent topic models and neural embedding approaches. However, many of these methods deliver poor results when applied to OSN data as such text is notoriously short and noisy, and often results are not comparable across studies. In this study we evaluate several techniques for document clustering and topic modelling on three datasets from Twitter and Reddit. We benchmark four different feature representations derived from term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) matrices and word embedding models combined with four clustering methods, and we include a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model for comparison. Several different evaluation measures are used in the literature, so we provide a discussion and recommendation for the most appropriate extrinsic measures for this task. We also demonstrate the performance of the methods over data sets with different document lengths. Our results show that clustering techniques applied to neural embedding feature representations delivered the best performance over all data sets using appropriate extrinsic evaluation measures. We also demonstrate a method for interpreting the clusters with a top-words based approach using tf-idf weights combined with embedding distance measures."}}

In this paper, we propose a new dual implicit mining-based latent friend recommendation model that simultaneously considers the implicit interest topics of users and the implicit link relationships between the users in the local topic cliques. Specifically, we first propose an algorithm called all reviews from a user and all tags from their corresponding items to learn the implicit interest topics of the users and their corresponding topic weights, then compute the user interest topic similarity using a symmetric Jensen-Shannon divergence. After that, we adopt the proposed weighted local random walk with restart algorithm to analyze the implicit link relationships between the users in the local topic cliques and calculate the weighted link relationship similarity between the users. Combining the user interest topic similarity with the weighted link relationship similarity in a unified way, we get the final latent friend recommendation list. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art latent friend recommendation methods under four different types of evaluation metrics."}}

It is an essential element of airline and passenger safety which aims to provide the expected level of confidence and to ensure the safety of passengers and the aviation industry. In recent years, security at airports has gone through noticeable improvements with the utilisation of advanced technology and highly trained security officers. However, for many airports, it is important to find the best compromise between the capacity of the security area, the number of passengers and the number of screening machines and officers to maintain a high level of security and to ensure that the cost and waiting times for passengers and airlines are at acceptable levels. This paper proposes a novel method based on queueing theory augmented with particle swarm optimisation (QT-PSO) to predict passenger waiting times in a security screening context. This model consists of multiple servers operating in parallel and takes into consideration the complete scenario such as normal, slow and express lanes. Such an approach has the potential to be a reliable model that is able to assimilate variations in the number of passengers, security officers and security machines on the service time. To evaluate our proposed method, we collected real-world security screening data from an Australian airport from December to March for the two consecutive years of 2016 and 2017. The results show that our proposed QT-PSO method is superior to predict the average waiting time of passengers compared to the state of the art."}}

Identification of the class of neuroblastoma is dependent on histopathological classification performed by pathologists which are considered the gold standard. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of neuroblast tumours, the human eye can miss critical visual features in histopathology. Hence, the use of computer-based models can assist pathologists in classification through mathematical analysis. There is no publicly available dataset containing neuroblastoma histopathological images. So, this study uses dataset gathered from The Tumour Bank at Kids Research at The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead, which has been used in previous research. Previous work on this dataset has shown maximum accuracy of 84%. One main issue that previous research fails to address is the class imbalance problem that exists in the dataset as one class represents over 50% of the samples. This study explores a range of feature extraction and data undersampling and over-sampling techniques to improve classification accuracy. Using these methods, this study was able to achieve accuracy of over 90% in the dataset. Moreover, significant improvements observed in this study were in the minority classes where previous work failed to achieve high level of classification accuracy. In doing so, this study shows importance of effective management of available data for any application of machine learning."}}

We provide both view of the entire patient cohort in the similarity space and the genomic details currently for comparison among the patients. Through the similarity space and on the selected genes of interest, we are able to perceive the genetic similarity throughout the cohort. From the linked heat map visualisation of the selected genes, we apply hierarchical clustering on both the horizontal and vertical axes to group together the genetically similar patients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the visualization with two case studies on pediatric cancer patients suffering from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and from Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)."}}

Multi-labeled data has several challenges, including class imbalance, label correlation, incomplete multi-label matrices, and noisy and irrelevant features. In this article, we propose an integrated multi-label classification approach with incomplete label space and class imbalance (ML-CIB) for simultaneously training the multi-label classification model and addressing the aforementioned challenges. The model learns a new label matrix and captures new label correlations, because it is difficult to find a complete label vector for each instance in real-world data. We also propose a label regularization to handle the imbalanced multi-labeled issue in the new label, and l1 regularization norm is incorporated in the objective function to select the relevant sparse features. A multi-label feature selection (ML-CIB-FS) method is presented as a variant of the proposed ML-CIB to show the efficacy of the proposed method in selecting the relevant features. ML-CIB is formulated as a constrained objective function. We use the accelerated proximal gradient method to solve the proposed optimisation problem. Last, extensive experiments are conducted on 19 regular-scale and large-scale imbalanced multi-labeled datasets. The promising results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art."}}
