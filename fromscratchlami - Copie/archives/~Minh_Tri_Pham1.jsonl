Direct similarities, transformations consisting of a direct isometry and a positive uniform scaling, present even more of a challenge\u2014one which we demonstrate and address here. In this article, we investigate divergences (a superset of distances without constraints on symmetry and sub-additivity) for comparing direct similarities, and means induced by them via minimizing a sum of squared divergences. We analyze several standard divergences: the Euclidean distance using the matrix representation of direct similarities, a divergence from Lie group theory, and the family of all left-invariant distances derived from Riemannian geometry. We derive their properties and those of their induced means, highlighting several shortcomings. In addition, we introduce a novel family of left-invariant divergences, called SRT divergences, which resolve several issues associated with the standard divergences. In our evaluation we empirically demonstrate the derived properties of the divergences and means, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on synthetic data. Finally, we compare the divergences in a real-world application: vote-based, scale-invariant object recognition. Our results show that the new divergences presented here, and their means, are both more effective and faster to compute for this task."}}

The lack of color information and limitations of current commodity depth sensors make this task a challenging computer vision problem, and a standard random sampling based approach is prohibitively time-consuming. We propose to address this difficult problem by generating promising inlier sets for pose estimation by early rejection of clear outliers with the help of local belief propagation (or dynamic programming). By exploiting data-parallelism our method is fast, and we also do not rely on a computationally expensive training phase. We demonstrate state-of-the art performance on a standard dataset and illustrate our approach on challenging real sequences."}}

The first, intrinsic Hough, solves the problem of exponential memory requirements of the standard Hough transform by exploiting the sparsity of the Hough space. The second, minimum-entropy Hough, explains away incorrect votes, substantially reducing the number of modes in the posterior distribution of class and pose, and improving precision. Our experiments demonstrate that these contributions make the Hough transform not only tractable but also highly accurate for our example application. Both contributions can be applied to other tasks that already use the standard Hough transform."}}

We formulate the problem as optimization over the manifold of valid depth maps of body shapes learned from synthetic training data. The manifold itself is represented using a novel data structure, a Multi-Resolution Manifold Forest (MRMF), which contains vertical edges between tree nodes as well as horizontal edges between nodes across trees that correspond to overlapping partitions. We show that this data structure allows both efficient localization and navigation on the manifold for on-the-fly building of local linear models (manifold charting). We demonstrate shape estimation of clothed users, showing significant improvement in accuracy over global shape models and models using pre-computed clusters. We further compare the MRMF with alternative manifold charting methods on a public dataset for estimating 3D motion from noisy 2D marker observations, obtaining state-of-the-art results."}}

We apply the distance to the problems of 3D shape recognition from point clouds and 2D object tracking in color video. For the former, we introduce a hashing scheme for scale and translation which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach on a public dataset. For the latter, we incorporate online subspace learning with the proposed FAQ representation to highlight the benefits of the new representation."}}

These problems benefit from the contraction moves\u2019 greater scope for removing instances from the model, reducing label costs.

It is left-invariant, unlike Euclidean distance, and has a unique, closed-form mean, in contrast to Riemannian distance, so is fast to compute. We demonstrate improved performance over the state of the art in both recognition and registration on a real and challenging dataset, by comparing our distance with others in a mean shift framework, as well as with the commonly used Hough voting approach."}}

We propose a method that extends the integral image to do fast integration over the interior of any polygon that is not necessarily rectilinear. The integration time of the method is fast, independent of the image resolution, and only linear to the polygon's number of vertices. We apply the method to Viola and Jones' object detection framework, in which we propose to improve classical Haar-like features with polygonal Haar-like features. We show that the extended feature set improves object detection's performance. The experiments are conducted in three domains: frontal face detection, fixed-pose hand detection, and rock detection for Mars' surface terrain assessment."}}

The framework attempts to identify vertical corner edges of buildings in the query image, which we term VCLH, as well as the neighboring plane normals, through vanishing point analysis. A bottom-up process further groups VCLH into elemental planes and subsequently into 3D structural fragments modulo a similarity transformation. A geometric hashing lookup allows us to rapidly establish multiple candidate correspondences between the structural fragments and the 2D map building contours. A voting-based camera pose estimation method is then employed to recover the correspondences admitting a camera pose solution with high consensus. In a dataset that is even challenging for humans, the system returned a top-30 ranking for correct matches out of 3600 camera pose hypotheses (0.83% selectivity) for 50.9% of queries."}}

A means for determining the ideal constant asymmetric goal is provided, which is theoretically justified under a conservative bound on the ROC operating point target and empirically near-optimal under the exact bound. Moreover, our method automatically minimizes the number of weak classifiers, avoiding the need to retrain a boosted classifier multiple times for empirical best performance as in conventional methods. Experimental results shows significant reduction in training time and number of weak classifiers, as well as better accuracy, compared to conventional cascades and multi-exit boosted classifiers."}}
