In essence, CDE-GAN incorporates dual evolution with respect to the generator(s) and discriminators into a unified evolutionary adversarial framework to conduct effective adversarial multi-objective optimization.

Specifically, CDE-GAN decomposes the complex adversarial optimization problem into two subproblems (generation and discrimination), and each subproblem is solved with a separated subpopulation (E-Generators and E-Discriminators), evolved by its own evolutionary algorithm. Additionally, we further propose a Soft Mechanism to balance the trade-off between E-Generators and E-Discriminators to conduct steady training for CDE-GAN.

Most existing methods leverage language models to generate class-prototypes and use them to arrange the locations of all categories in the common space for photos and sketches. Although great progress has been made, few of them consider whether such pre-defined prototypes are necessary for ZS-SBIR, where locations of unseen class samples in the embedding space are actually determined by visual appearance and a visual embedding actually performs better. To this end, we propose a novel Norm-guided Adaptive Visual Embedding (NAVE) model, for adaptively building the common space\nbased on visual similarity instead of languagebased pre-defined prototypes. To further enhance the representation quality of unseen classes for both photo and sketch modality, modality norm discrepancy and noisy label regularizer are jointly employed to measure and repair the modality bias of the learned common embedding. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NAVE over state-of-the-art competitors."}}

Prior works either simply align the global features of an image with its associated class semantic vector or utilize unidirectional attention to learn the limited latent semantic representations, which could not effectively discover the intrinsic semantic knowledge (e.g., attribute semantics) between visual and attribute features. To solve the above dilemma, we propose a Mutually Semantic Distillation Network (MSDN), which progressively distills the intrinsic semantic representations between visual and attribute features for ZSL. MSDN incorporates an attribute->visual attention sub-net that learns attribute-based visual features, and a visual->attribute attention sub-net that learns visual-based attribute features. By further introducing a semantic distillation loss, the two mutual attention sub-nets are capable of learning collaboratively and teaching each other throughout the training process. The proposed MSDN yields significant improvements over the strong baselines, leading to new state-of-the-art performances on three popular challenging benchmarks. "}}

Studies on the generative ZSL methods typically produce visual features of unseen classes to mitigate the issue of lacking unseen samples based on the predefined class semantic prototypes. As these empirically designed prototypes are not able to faithfully represent the actual semantic prototypes of visual features (i.e., visual prototypes), existing methods limit their ability to synthesize visual features that accurately represent real features and prototypes. We formulate this phenomenon as a visual-semantic domain shift problem. It prevents the generative models from further improving the ZSL performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic semantic prototype learning (DSP) method to align the empirical and actual semantic prototypes for synthesizing accurate visual features. The alignment is conducted by jointly refining semantic prototypes and visual features so that the generator synthesizes visual features which are close to the real ones. We utilize a visual$\\rightarrow$semantic mapping network (V2SM) to map both the synthesized and real features into the class semantic space. The V2SM benefits the generator to synthesize visual representations with rich semantics. The real/synthesized visual features supervise our visual-oriented semantic prototype evolving network (VOPE) where the predefined class semantic prototypes are iteratively evolved to become dynamic semantic prototypes. Such prototypes are then fed back to the generative network as conditional supervision. Finally, we enhance visual features by fusing the evolved semantic prototypes into their corresponding visual features. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our DSP improves existing generative ZSL methods, \\textit{e.g.}, the average improvements of the harmonic mean over four baselines (e.g., CLSWGAN, f-VAEGAN, TF-VAEGAN and FREE) by 8.5\\%, 8.0\\% and 9.7\\% on CUB, SUN and AWA2, respectively."}}

However, existing generative methods simply use visual features extracted by the pre-trained CNN backbone. These visual features lack attribute-level semantic information. Consequently, seen classes are indistinguishable, and the knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Semantic Compression Embedding Guided Generation (SC-EGG) model, which cascades a semantic compression embedding network (SCEN) and an embedding guided generative network (EGGN). The SCEN extracts a group of attribute-level local features for each sample and further compresses them into the new low-dimension visual feature. Thus, a dense-semantic visual space is obtained. The EGGN learns a mapping from the class-level semantic space to the dense-semantic visual space, thus improving the discriminability of the synthesized dense-semantic unseen visual features. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., CUB, SUN and AWA2, demonstrate the signi\ufb01cant performance gains of SC-EGG over current state-of-the-art methods and its baselines."}}
