Recent efforts to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind the brain's encoding of the self-body have led to various attempts to develop a unified theoretical framework to explain related behavioral and neurophysiological phenomena. A central question to be explained is how body illusions such as the rubber hand illusion actually occur. Despite the conceptual descriptions of the mechanisms of bodily self-consciousness and the possible relevant brain areas, the existing theoretical models still lack an explanation of the computational mechanisms by which the brain encodes the perception of one's body and how our subjectively perceived body illusions can be generated by neural networks. Here we integrate the biological findings of bodily self-consciousness to propose a Brain-inspired bodily self-perception model, by which perceptions of bodily self can be autonomously constructed without any supervision signals. We successfully validated our computational model with six rubber hand illusion experiments and a disability experiment on platforms including a iCub humanoid robot and simulated environments. The experimental results show that our model can not only well replicate the behavioral and neural data of monkeys in biological experiments, but also reasonably explain the causes and results of the rubber hand illusion from the neuronal level due to advantages in biological interpretability, thus contributing to the revealing of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying the occurrence of the rubber hand illusion."}}

Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based Liquid State Machine (LSM) serves as a suitable architecture to study brain-inspired intelligence because of its brain-inspired structure and the potential for integrating multiple biological principles. Existing researches on LSM focus on different certain perspectives, including high-dimensional encoding or optimization of the liquid layer, network architecture search, and application to hardware devices. There is still a lack of in-depth inspiration from the learning and structural evolution mechanism of the brain. Considering these limitations, this paper presents a novel LSM learning model that integrates adaptive structural evolution and multi-scale biological learning rules. For structural evolution, an adaptive evolvable LSM model is developed to optimize the neural architecture design of liquid layer with separation property. For brain-inspired learning of LSM, we propose a dopamine-modulated Bienenstock-Cooper-Munros (DA-BCM) method that incorporates global long-term dopamine regulation and local trace-based BCM synaptic plasticity. Comparative experimental results on different decision-making tasks show that introducing structural evolution of the liquid layer, and the DA-BCM regulation of the liquid layer and the readout layer could improve the decision-making ability of LSM and flexibly adapt to rule reversal. This work is committed to exploring how evolution can help to design more appropriate network architectures and how multi-scale neuroplasticity principles coordinated to enable the optimization and learning of LSMs for relatively complex decision-making tasks."}}

Although the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) model could solve such problems to a certain extent, the development is still limited by its high algorithm complexity, slow convergence speed, and poor test robustness. Inspired by the learning and memory mechanism of the brain, this paper proposed a Memory Transformation based Differentiable Neural Computer (MT-DNC) model. MT-DNC incorporates working memory and long-term memory into DNC, and realizes the autonomous transformation of acquired experience between working memory and long-term memory, thereby helping to effectively extract acquired knowledge to improve reasoning ability. Experimental results on bAbI question answering task demonstrated that our proposed method achieves superior performance and faster convergence speed compared to other existing DNN and DNC models. Ablation studies also indicated that the memory transformation from working memory to long-term memory plays essential role in improving the robustness and stability of reasoning. This work explores how brain-inspired memory transformation can be integrated and applied to complex intelligent dialogue and reasoning systems."}}

Brain-inspired artificial intelligence serves as a computational continuation of this natural evolutionary process, is imperative to take inspiration from the evolutionary mechanisms of brain structure and function. Studies suggest that the human brain's high efficiency and low energy consumption may be closely related to its small-world topology and critical dynamics. However, existing efforts on the performance-oriented structural evolution of spiking neural networks (SNNs) are time-consuming and ignore the core structural properties of the brain. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective Evolutionary Liquid State Machine (ELSM) with the combination of small-world coefficient and criticality as evolution goals and simultaneously integrate the topological properties of spiking neural networks from static and dynamic perspectives to guide the emergence of brain-inspired efficient structures."}}

Although the traditional artificial neural network using fixed-length vectors to represent symbols has gained good performance in some specific tasks, it is still a black box that lacks interpretability, far from how humans perceive the world. Inspired by the grandmother-cell hypothesis in neuroscience, this work investigates how population encoding and spiking timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms can be integrated into the learning of spiking neural networks, and how a population of neurons can represent a symbol via guiding the completion of sequential firing between different neuron populations. The neuron populations of different communities together constitute the entire commonsense knowledge graph, forming a giant graph spiking neural network. Moreover, we introduced the Reward-modulated spiking timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) mechanism to simulate the biological reinforcement learning process and completed the related reasoning tasks accordingly, achieving comparable accuracy and faster convergence speed than the graph convolutional artificial neural networks. For the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science, the work in this paper provided the foundation of computational modeling for further exploration of the way the human brain represents commonsense knowledge. For the field of artificial intelligence, this paper indicated the exploration direction for realizing a more robust and interpretable neural network by constructing a commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning spiking neural networks with solid biological plausibility."}}

Multiple comparison paradigms have been proposed to explore the distinctions between humans and deep learning. While most comparisons rely on corruptions inspired by mathematical transformations, very few have bases on human cognitive phenomena. In this study, we propose a novel corruption method based on the abutting grating illusion, which is a visual phenomenon widely discovered in both human and a wide range of animal species. The corruption method destroys the gradient-defined boundaries and generates the perception of illusory contours using line gratings abutting each other. We applied the method on MNIST, high resolution MNIST, and silhouette object images. Various deep learning models are tested on the corruption, including models trained from scratch and 109 models pretrained with ImageNet or various data augmentation techniques. Our results show that abutting grating corruption is challenging even for state-of-the-art deep learning models because most models are randomly guessing. We also discovered that the DeepAugment technique can greatly improve robustness against abutting grating illusion. Visualisation of early layers indicates that better performing models exhibit stronger end-stopping property, which is consistent with neuroscience discoveries. To validate the corruption method, 24 human subjects are involved to classify samples of corrupted datasets."}}

Most affective empathy models focus on the recognition and simulation of facial expressions or emotional speech of humans, namely Affective Computing. However, these studies lack the guidance of neural mechanisms of affective empathy. From a neuroscience perspective, affective empathy is formed gradually during the individual development process: experiencing own emotion\u2014forming the corresponding Mirror Neuron System (MNS)\u2014understanding the emotions of others through the mirror mechanism.

For the objective of human-like artificial intelligence, we expect to provide multisensory and text-derived representations for concepts in AI systems. Psychologists and computer scientists have published lots of datasets for the two kinds of representations, but as far as we know, no systematic work exits to analyze them together. We do a statistical study on them in this work. We want to know if multisensory vectors and text-derived vectors reflect conceptual understanding and if they are complementary in terms of cognition. Four experiments are presented in this work, all focused on multisensory representations labeled by psychologists and text-derived representations generated by computer scientists for concept learning, and the results demonstrate that (1) for the same concept, both forms of representations can properly reflect the concept, but (2) the representational similarity analysis findings reveal that the two types of representations are significantly different, (3) as the concreteness of the concept grows larger, the multisensory representation of the concept becomes closer to human beings than the text-derived representation, and (4) we verified that combining the two improves the concept representation."}}

However, the ways in which sequential information is represented and memorized are not dealt with satisfactorily by existing models. To overcome this deficiency, this paper introduces a spiking neural network based on psychological and neurobiological findings at multiple scales. Compared with existing methods, our model has four novel features: (1) It contains several collaborative subnetworks similar to those in brain regions with different cognitive functions. The individual building blocks of the simulated areas are neural functional minicolumns composed of biologically plausible neurons. Both excitatory and inhibitory connections between neurons are modulated dynamically using a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. (2) Inspired by the mechanisms of the brain's cortical-striatal loop, a dependent timing module is constructed to encode temporal information, which is essential in sequence learning but has not been processed well by traditional algorithms. (3) Goal-based and episodic retrievals can be achieved at different time scales. (4) Musical memory is used as an application to validate the model. Experiments show that the model can store a huge amount of data on melodies and recall them with high accuracy. In addition, it can remember the entirety of a melody given only an episode or the melody played at different paces."}}
