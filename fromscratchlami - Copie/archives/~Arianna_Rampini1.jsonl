However, while several efforts have been devoted to the design of new convolutional architectures, pooling or positional encoding schemes, relatively little focus has been spent on modeling pairwise problems such as signal transfer, graph isomorphism and subgraph correspondence tasks. With this paper, we anticipate the need for a convenient framework to deal with problems that revolve around the notion of a map among graphs, and focus in particular on the challenging subgraph alignment scenario. We claim that, first and foremost, the representation of a map plays a central role in how these problems should be modeled -- be it a map inference problem or a simpler signal transport task. Taking the hint from recent work in geometry processing, we propose the adoption of a spectral representation for maps that is compact, easy to compute, permutation-equivariant, easy to plug into learning pipelines, and especially effective for a wide range of situations, most notably when dealing with subgraph alignment problems. We further report for the first time a surprising phenomenon where the partiality arising in subgraph alignment is manifested in the structure of the map coefficients, even in the absence of exact isomorphism, and which is consistently observed over different families of graphs."}}

For instance, when coarsening or rewiring operations are present along the pipeline, one needs to keep track of the corresponding nodes between the original and modified graphs. Classically, these maps are represented as binary node-to-node correspondence matrices and used as-is to transfer node-wise features between the graphs. In this paper, we argue that simply changing this map representation can bring notable benefits to graph learning tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in geometry processing, we introduce a spectral representation for maps that is easy to integrate into existing graph learning models. This spectral representation is a compact and straightforward plug-in replacement and is robust to topological changes of the graphs. Remarkably, the representation exhibits structural properties that make it interpretable, drawing an analogy with recent results on smooth manifolds. We demonstrate the benefits of incorporating spectral maps in graph learning pipelines, addressing scenarios where a node-to-node map is not well defined, or in the absence of exact isomorphism. Our approach bears practical benefits in knowledge distillation and hierarchical learning, where we show comparable or improved performance at a fraction of the computational cost."}}

Typical issues faced by geometry processing algorithms include the variety of discrete representations for 3D data (point clouds, polygonal or tet-meshes and voxels), or the type of deformation this data may undergo. Powerful approaches to address these issues come from looking at the spectral decomposition of canonical differential operators, such as the Laplacian, which provides a rich, informative, robust, and invariant representation of the 3D objects. The focus of this tutorial is on computational spectral geometry. We will offer a different perspective on spectral geometric techniques, supported by recent successful methods in the graphics and 3D vision communities and older but notoriously overlooked results. We will discuss both the \u201cforward\u201d path typical of spectral geometry pipelines (e.g. computing Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given shape) with its widespread applicative relevance, and the inverse path (e.g. recovering a shape from given Laplacian eigenvalues, like in the classical \u201chearing the shape of the drum\u201d problem) with its ill-posed nature and the benefits showcased on several challenging tasks in graphics and geometry processing."}}

However, the existence of \"universal\" attacks (i.e., unique perturbations that transfer across different data points) has only been demonstrated for images to date. Part of the reason lies in the lack of a common domain, for geometric data such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds, where a universal perturbation can be defined. In this paper, we offer a change in perspective and demonstrate the existence of universal attacks for geometric data (shapes). We introduce a computational procedure that operates entirely in the spectral domain, where the attacks take the form of small perturbations to short eigenvalue sequences; the resulting geometry is then synthesized via shape-from-spectrum recovery. Our attacks are universal, in that they transfer across different shapes, different representations (meshes and point clouds), and generalize to previously unseen data."}}

The core of our approach consists in a cycle-consistent module that maps between a learned latent space and sequences of eigenvalues. This module provides an efficient and effective link between the shape geometry, encoded in a latent vector, and its Laplacian spectrum. Our proposed data-driven approach replaces the need for ad-hoc regularizers required by prior methods, while providing more accurate results at a fraction of the computational cost. Moreover, these latent space connections enable novel applications for both analyzing and controlling the spectral properties of deformable shapes, especially in the context of a shape collection. Our learning model and the associated analysis apply without modifications across different dimensions (2D and 3D shapes alike), representations (meshes, contours and point clouds), nature of the latent space (generated by an auto-encoder or a parametric model), as well as across different shape classes, and admits arbitrary resolution of the input spectrum without affecting complexity. The increased flexibility allows us to address notoriously difficult tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing within a unified framework, including shape generation from spectrum, latent space exploration and analysis, mesh super-resolution, shape exploration, style transfer, spectrum estimation for point clouds, segmentation transfer and non-rigid shape matching."}}

Such problems arise in several challenging tasks in 3D vision and graphics, including partial shape similarity, retrieval, and non-rigid correspondence. We phrase the problem as one of alignment between short sequences of eigenvalues of basic differential operators, which are constructed upon a scalar function defined on the 3D surfaces. Our method therefore seeks for a scalar function that entails this alignment. Differently from existing approaches, we do not require solving for a correspondence between the query and the target, therefore greatly simplifying the optimization process; our core technique is also descriptor-free, as it is driven by the geometry of the two objects as encoded in their operator spectra. We further show that our spectral alignment algorithm provides a remarkably simple alternative to the recent shape-from-spectrum reconstruction approaches. For both applications, we demonstrate improvement over the state-of-the-art either in terms of accuracy or computational cost."}}

While theoretically the answer to this question is negative (there exist examples of iso-spectral but non-isometric manifolds), little is known about the practical possibility of using the spectrum for shape reconstruction and optimization. In this paper, we introduce a numerical procedure called isospectralization, consisting of deforming one shape to make its Laplacian spectrum match that of another. We implement the isospectralization procedure using modern differentiable programming techniques and exemplify its applications in some of the classical and notoriously hard problems in geometry processing, computer vision, and graphics such as shape reconstruction, pose and style transfer, and dense deformable correspondence."}}
