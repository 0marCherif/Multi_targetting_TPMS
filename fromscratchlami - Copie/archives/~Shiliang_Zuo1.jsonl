In non-convex settings, it has been shown that gradient descent is able to escape saddle points asymptotically and converge to local minimizers [Lee et. al. 2016]. Recent studies also show a perturbed version of gradient descent is enough to escape saddle points efficiently [Jin et. al. 2015, Ge et. al. 2017]. In this paper we show a negative result: gradient descent may take exponential time to escape saddle points, with non-pathological two dimensional functions. While our focus is theoretical, we also conduct experiments verifying our theoretical result. Through our analysis we demonstrate that stochasticity is essential to escape saddle points efficiently."}}

With an increasing number of students entering STEM disciplines, the question of how to effectively train students\u00bb spatial visualization skills has become very important. While a scalable existing solution is to implement online workshops for students, the problem of how to motivate students to participate in these online workshops remains unsolved. In this study, we studied gamification as a way to motivate first year engineering students to take part in an online workshop designed to train their spatial visualization skills. Our game contains eight modules, each designed to train a different component of spatial visualization. The game records players\u00bb in-game behavior with high granularity, which allows us to provide automated, scalable feedback on players\u00bb problem-solving strategies. Ten students with different levels of spatial ability played our game and expressed a strong interest in using the game to train their spatial visualization skills in the future. In addition, our analysis of players\u00bb in-game behaviors shows the potential benefits of implementing adaptive and personalized learning guidance."}}

Thanks to innovations in multilayer soft lithography (MSL) fabrication technology, the integration of thousands of microvalves along with large-scale networks of microchannels on a chip has been enabled. This progress has even been compared to the evolution of VLSI circuits following Moore's Law. In flow-based microfluidic biochips, microvalves are critical components to control the fluidic transportation for complex operations. To activate the open/close states of a microvalve, off-chip control pins are required. Due to the tremendous increase of the number of microvalves, a software-programmable microfluidic platform has been proposed to reduce the number of off-chip control pins, which integrates a microfluidic multiplexer on a separate control layer to control the array of microvalves. The multiplexer needs to be switched when the states of microvalves are changed between every two adjacent time slots. High switching frequency will make the multiplexer vulnerable and decrease the chip's reliability. We observe that different switching orders of microvalves lead to different switching frequencies of a multiplexer. Based on this observation, this paper proposes the first Hamming-distance-based switching order optimization method for microvalves to enhance the reliability of the multiplexer. Experimental results show that our method can significantly reduce the switching frequency of multiplexer, and the solution is very close to the theoretical optimal lower bound."}}

One critical issue with flow-based microfluidic biochips is the large number of microvalves that require peripheral control pins. Even using the broadcasting addressing scheme, i.e., one control pin controls multiple microvalves simultaneously, thousands of microvalves would still require hundreds of control prins, which is unrealistic. To address this critical challenge in control scalability, the control-layer multiplexer is introduced to effectively reduce the number of control pins into log scale of the number of microvalves. There are two practical design issues with the control-layer multiplexer: (1) the reliability issue caused by the frequent control-valve switching, and (2) the pressure degradation problem caused by the control-valve switching without pressure refreshing from the pressure source. This paper addresses these two design issues by the proposed Hamming-distance-based switching sequence optimization method and the XOR-based pressure refreshing method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods with an average 77.2% (maximum 89.6%) improvement in total pressure refreshing cost, and an average 88.5% (maximum 90.0%) improvement in pressure deviation."}}
