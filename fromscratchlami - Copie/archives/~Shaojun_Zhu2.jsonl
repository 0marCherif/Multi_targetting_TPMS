Key features are the use of off-the-shelf physics engines and the adaptation of a Bayesian optimization technique towards minimizing the number of real-world experiments needed for model-based reinforcement learning. The proposed framework reproduces in a physics engine experiments performed on a real robot and optimizes the model's mechanical parameters so as to match real-world trajectories. The optimized model is then used for learning a policy in simulation, before real-world deployment. It is well understood, however, that it is hard to exactly reproduce real trajectories in simulation. Moreover, a near-optimal policy can be frequently found with an imperfect model. Therefore, this work proposes a strategy for identifying a model that is just good enough to approximate the value of a locally optimal policy with a certain confidence, instead of wasting effort on identifying the most accurate model. Evaluations, performed both in simulation and on a real robotic manipulation task, indicate that the proposed strategy results in an overall time-efficient, integrated model identification and learning solution, which significantly improves the data-efficiency of existing policy search algorithms."}}

A key insight in this case is the need to project the system identification challenge into an appropriate lower dimensionalspace. Comparisons with alternatives indicate that the proposed method can identify the parameters more accurately within the given time budget, which also results in more precise locomotion control."}}

The proposed method utilizes a physics engine, where the robot seeks to identify the inertial and friction parameters of the object by simulating its motion under different values of the parameters and identifying those that result in a simulation which matches the observed real motions. The problem is solved in a Bayesian optimization framework. The same framework is used for both identifying the model of an object online and searching for a policy that would minimize a given cost function according to the identified model. Experimental results both in simulation and using a real robot indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning approaches."}}

The two systems differ on how they pick objects. The first tool provides increased flexibility, while the vacuum alternative is simpler and smaller. The aim is to show how the end-effector influences the success rate and speed of robotic picking. For the study, the same planning process is followed for known poses of multiple objects with different geometries and characteristics. The resulting trajectories are executed on a real system showing that, under different conditions, different types of end-effectors can be beneficial. This motivates the development of hybrid solutions."}}

The first one automatically encodes object location prior to predict visual saliency without the requirement of center-biased assumption, while the second one estimates image saliency using contrast with respect to background regions. The proposed framework consists of the following three basic steps: In the top-down process, we create a specific location saliency map (SLSM), which can be identified by a set of overlapping windows likely to cover salient objects. The binary segmentation masks of training windows are treated as high-level knowledge to be transferred to the test image windows, which may share visual similarity with training windows. In the bottom-up process, a multi-layer segmentation framework is employed, which is able to provide vast robust background candidate regions specified by SLSM. Then the background contrast saliency map (BCSM) is computed based on low-level image stimuli features. SLSM and BCSM are finally integrated to a pixel-accurate saliency map. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results over MSRA 1000 and SED datasets."}}

To address this problem, we propose the so called Adjacent Coding (AC), which employs the adjacency of one descriptor to express the local spatial context. Different from traditional coding methods, Adjacent Coding encodes one descriptor and its adjacent neighbors together.
