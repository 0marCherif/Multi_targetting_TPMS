Hand Detection and Hand-Body Association in the Wild", "abstract": "We study a new problem of detecting hands and finding the location of the corresponding person for each detected hand. This task is helpful for many downstream tasks such as hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Associating hands with people is challenging in unconstrained conditions since multiple people can be present in the scene with varying overlaps and occlusions. We propose a novel end-to-end trainable convolutional network that can Jointly detect hands and the body location for the corresponding person. Our method first detects a set of hands and bodies and uses a novel Hand-Body Association Network to predict association scores between them. We use these association scores to find the body location for each detected hand. We also introduce a new challenging dataset called BodyHands containing uncon-strained images with hand and their corresponding body locations annotations. We conduct extensive experiments on BodyHands and another public dataset to show the effectiveness of our method. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of hand-body association in two critical applications: hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Our experiments show that hand tracking and hand contact estimation methods can be improved significantly by reasoning about the hand-body association.

HandLer is based on Cascade-RCNN with additional three novel stages. The first stage is Forward Propagation, where the features from frame t \u22121 are propagated to frame t based on previously detected hands and their estimated motion. The second stage is the Detection and Backward Regression, which uses outputs from the forward propagation to detect hands for frame t and their relative offset in frame t \u22121. The third stage uses an off-the-shelf human pose method to link any fragmented hand tracklets. We train the forward propagation and backward regression and detection stages end-to-end together with the other Cascade-RCNN components. To train and evaluate HandLer, we also contribute YouTube-Hand, the first challenging large-scale dataset of unconstrained videos annotated with hand locations and their trajectories. Experiments on this dataset and other benchmarks show that HandLer outperforms the existing state-of-the-art tracking algorithms by a large margin.

This is a challenging inference task given the need to reason beyond the local appearance of hands. The lack of training annotations indicating which object or parts of an object the hand is in contact with further complicates the task. We propose a novel convolutional network based on Mask-RCNN that can jointly learn to localize hands and predict their physical contact to address this problem. The network uses outputs from another object detector to obtain locations of objects present in the scene. It uses these outputs and hand locations to recognize the hand's contact state using two attention mechanisms. The first attention mechanism is based on the hand and a region's affinity, enclosing the hand and the object, and densely pools features from this region to the hand region. The second attention module adaptively selects salient features from this plausible region of contact. To develop and evaluate our method's performance, we introduce a large-scale dataset called ContactHands, containing unconstrained images annotated with hand locations and contact states. The proposed network, including the parameters of attention modules, is end-to-end trainable. This network achieves approximately 7% relative improvement over a baseline network that was built on the vanilla Mask-RCNN architecture and trained for recognizing hand contact states."}}
