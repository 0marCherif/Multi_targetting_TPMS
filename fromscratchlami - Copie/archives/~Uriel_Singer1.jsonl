Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today\u2019s image generation models.

We propose AudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model, operating on a learnt discrete audio representation, that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high fidelity audio requires one to operate over extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. Finally, we apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. We further conduct an ablation study to gauge the effects of pre-trained text and audio components."}}

However, since they require large-scale datasets of text-image pairs, it is impractical to train them on new domains where data is scarce or not labeled.\nIn this work, we propose using large-scale retrieval methods, in particular, efficient k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN), which offers novel capabilities: (1) training a substantially small and efficient text-to-image diffusion model using only pre-trained multi-modal embeddings, but without an explicit text-image dataset, (2) generating out-of-distribution images by simply swapping the retrieval database at inference time, and (3) performing text-driven local semantic manipulations while preserving object identity. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we apply our kNN approach on two state-of-the-art diffusion backbones, and show results on several different datasets. As evaluated by human studies and automatic metrics, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches that train text-to-image generation models using images-only dataset."}}

However, reliable time series sales forecasting for e-commerce is difficult, especially during periods with many anomalies, as can often happen during pandemics, abnormal weather, or sports events. Although many time series algorithms have been applied to the task, prediction during anomalies still remains a challenge. In this work, we hypothesize that leveraging external knowledge found in world events can help overcome the challenge of prediction under anomalies. We mine a large repository of 40 years of world events and their textual representations. Further, we present a novel methodology based on transformers to construct an embedding of a day based on the relations of the day's events. Those embeddings are then used to forecast future consumer behavior. We empirically evaluate the methods over a large e-commerce products sales dataset, extracted from eBay, one of the world's largest online marketplaces. We show over numerous categories that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines during anomalies."}}

For a given product description, our goal is to generate questions that reflect potential user information needs that are either missing or not well covered in the description. Moreover, we wish to cover diverse user information needs that may span a multitude of product types. To this end, we first show how the T5 pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder model can be fine-tuned for the task. Yet, while the T5 generated questions have a reasonable quality compared to the state-of-the-art method for the task (KPCNet), many of such questions are still too general, resulting in a sub-optimal global question diversity. As an alternative, we propose a novel learning-to-diversify (LTD) fine-tuning approach that allows to enrich the language learned by the underlying Transformer model. Our empirical evaluation shows that, using our approach significantly improves the global diversity of the underlying Transformer model, while preserves, as much as possible, its generation relevance."}}

However, little work was dedicated to creating unbiased GNNs, i.e., where the classification is uncorrelated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. Some ignore the sensitive attributes or optimize for the criteria of statistical parity for fairness. However, it has been shown that neither approaches ensure fairness, but rather cripple the utility of the prediction task. In this work, we present a GNN framework that allows optimizing representations for the notion of Equalized Odds fairness criteria. The architecture is composed of three components: (1) a GNN classifier predicting the utility class, (2) a sampler learning the distribution of the sensitive attributes of the nodes given their labels. It generates samples fed into a (3) discriminator that discriminates between true and sampled sensitive attributes using a novel ``permutation loss'' function. Using these components, we train a model to neglect information regarding the sensitive attribute only with respect to its label. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to optimize GNNs for the equalized odds criteria. We evaluate our classifier over several graph datasets and sensitive attributes and show our algorithm reaches state-of-the-art results."}}
