Some papers introduced recently recurrent neural network models that deals with irregularity, but most of them rely on complex mechanisms to achieve a better performance. This work propose a novel method to represent timestamps (hours or dates) as dense vectors using sinusoidal functions, called Time Embeddings. As a data input method it and can be applied to most machine learning models. The method was evaluated with two predictive tasks from MIMIC III, a dataset of irregularly sampled time series of electronic health records. Our tests showed an improvement to LSTM-based and classical machine learning models, specially with very irregular data."}}

We only use financial records due to the unavailability of electronic medical records and exam results in several Brazilian health care institutions. The financial records used encodes medical procedures, hospital rates, materials and medicines. Our results succeed to predict complications over 60 to 360 days after the records processing with an area under ROC curve of 0.81 to 0.76 over time gaps. Also we introduce the possibility to visualize the attention mechanism of MedAttention to understand the patterns found."}}

A chronic condition, such as diabetes, is an illness that lasts a long time and does not go away, and often leads to the patient's health gradually getting worse. While recent works involve raw electronic health record (EHR) from hospitals, this work uses only financial records from health plan providers (medical claims) to predict diabetes disease evolution with a self-attentive recurrent neural network. The use of financial data is due to the possibility of being an interface to international standards, as the records standard encodes medical procedures. The main goal was to assess high risk diabetics, so we predict records related to diabetes acute complications such as amputations and debridements, revascularization and hemodialysis. Our work succeeds to anticipate complications between 60 to 240 days with an area under ROC curve ranging from 0.81 to 0.94. In this paper we describe the first half of a work-in-progress developed within a health plan provider with ROC curve ranging from 0.81 to 0.83. This assessment will give healthcare providers the chance to intervene earlier and head off hospitalizations. We are aiming to deliver personalized predictions and personalized recommendations to individual patients, with the goal of improving outcomes and reducing costs"}}
