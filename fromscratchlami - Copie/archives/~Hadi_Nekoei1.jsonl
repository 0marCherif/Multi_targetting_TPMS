We first start with giving a multi-agent estimation problem as a motivating example where SIBR converges while parallel iterative best response (PIBR) does not. Then we present a general implementation of staged multi-agent RL algorithms based on SIBR and multi-time scale stochastic approximation, and show that our new methods which we call Staged Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (SIPPO) and Staged Independent Q-learning (SIQL) outperform state-of-the-art independent learning on almost all the tasks in the epymarl \\citep{papoudakis2020benchmarking} benchmark. This can be seen as a first step towards more decentralized MARL methods based on SIBR and multi-time scale learning."}}

Whereas previous work was focusing on model variance, we propose a principled approach for directly estimating epistemic uncertainty by learning to predict generalization error and subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty, i.e., intrinsic unpredictability. This estimator of epistemic uncertainty includes the effect of model bias (or misspecification) and is useful in interactive learning environments arising in active learning or reinforcement learning. In addition to discussing these properties of Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP), we illustrate its advantage against existing methods for uncertainty estimation on downstream tasks including sequential model optimization and reinforcement learning. We also evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates from DEUP for probabilistic classification of images and for estimating uncertainty about synergistic drug combinations. "}}
