The algorithm operates under the minimal assumptions of realizable function class and access to online least squares and log loss regression oracles. Our algorithm is efficient (assuming efficient online regression oracles), simple and robust to approximation errors. It enjoys an $\\widetilde{O}(H^{2.5} \\sqrt{ T|S||A| ( \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{O}) + H \\log(\\delta^{-1}) )})$ regret guarantee, with $T$ being the number of episodes, $S$ the state space, $A$ the action space, $H$ the horizon and $\\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{O}) = \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{sq}}^\\mathcal{F}) + \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{log}}^\\mathcal{P})$ is the sum of the regression oracles' regret, used to approximate the context-dependent rewards and dynamics, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient rate optimal regret minimization algorithm for adversarial CMDPs that operates under the minimal standard assumption of online function approximation."}}

We analyze three different settings: where the dynamics is known, where the dynamics is unknown but independent of the context and the most challenging setting where the dynamics is unknown and context-dependent. For the latter, our algorithm obtains regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}( (H+{1}/{p_{min}})H|S|^{3/2}\\sqrt{|A|T\\log(\\max\\{|\\mathcal{G}|,|\\mathcal{P}|\\}/\\delta)})$ with probability $1-\\delta$, where $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ are finite and realizable function classes used to approximate the dynamics and rewards respectively, $p_{min}$ is the minimum reachability parameter, $S$ is the set of states, $A$ the set of actions, $H$ the horizon, and $T$ the number of episodes. To our knowledge, our approach is the first optimistic approach applied to contextual MDPs with general function approximation (i.e., without additional knowledge regarding the function class, such as it being linear and etc.). We present a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T H |S| |A| \\ln(|\\mathcal{G}|)/\\ln(|A|)})$, on the expected regret which holds even in the case of known dynamics. Lastly, we discuss an extension of our results to CMDPs without minimum reachability, that obtains $\\widetilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret."}}

We consider both the case that the dynamics dependent or independent of the context. For both models we derive polynomial sample and time complexity (assuming an efficient ERM oracle). Our methodology gives a general reduction from learning contextual MDP to supervised learning."}}
