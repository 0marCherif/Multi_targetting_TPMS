We determine f(x) by sequentially testing the variables of x, each of which is associated with a cost of testing and an independent probability of being true. If a strategy for solving the problem is adaptive in the sense that its next test can depend on the outcomes of previous tests, it has lower expected cost but may take up to exponential space to store. In contrast, a non-adaptive strategy may have higher expected cost but can be stored in linear space and benefit from parallel resources. The adaptivity gap, the ratio between the expected cost of the optimal non-adaptive and adaptive strategies, is a measure of the benefit of adaptivity. We present lower bounds on the adaptivity gap for the SBFE problem for popular classes of Boolean functions, including read-once DNF formulas, read-once formulas, and general DNFs. Our bounds range from $$\\varOmega (\\log n)$$ to $$\\varOmega (n/\\log n)$$ , contrasting with recent O(1) gaps shown for symmetric functions and linear threshold functions."}}

A doctor is assessing a patient\u2019s risk of developing a disease and can perform n different binary tests on the patient. The probability that test i is positive is $$p_i$$ p i and the outcomes of the n tests are independent. A patient\u2019s score is the total number of positive tests. Possible scores thus range between 0 and n. This range is divided into subranges, corresponding to risk classes (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH risk). Each test has an associated cost. To reduce testing cost, instead of performing all tests and determining an exact score, the doctor can perform tests sequentially and stop testing when it is possible to determine the patient\u2019s risk class. The problem is to determine the order in which the doctor should perform the tests, so as to minimize expected testing cost. We address the unit-cost case of the Stochastic Score Classification problem, and provide polynomial-time approximation algorithms for adaptive and non-adaptive versions of the problem. We also pose a number of open questions."}}

The Min-Sum Submodular Cover problem generalizes the NP-complete Min-Sum Set Cover problem, replacing the input set cover instance with a monotone submodular set function. A simple greedy algorithm achieves an approximation factor of 4, which is tight unless P=NP [Streeter and Golovin, NeurIPS, 2008]. We complement the greedy algorithm with analysis of a local search algorithm. Building on work of Munagala et al. [ICDT, 2005], we show that, using simple initialization, a straightforward local search algorithm achieves a $(4+\\epsilon)$-approximate solution in time $O(n^3\\log(n/\\epsilon))$, provided that the monotone submodular set function is also second-order supermodular. Second-order supermodularity has been shown to hold for a number of submodular functions of practical interest, including functions associated with set cover, matching, and facility location. We present experiments on two special cases of Min-Sum Submodular Cover and find that the local search algorithm can outperform the greedy algorithm on small data sets."}}
