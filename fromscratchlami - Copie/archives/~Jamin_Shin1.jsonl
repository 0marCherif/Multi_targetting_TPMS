Few-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) is a realistic solution to this problem. In this paper, we hypothesize that dialogue summaries are essentially unstructured dialogue states; hence, we propose to reformulate dialogue state tracking as a dialogue summarization problem. To elaborate, we train a text-to-text language model with synthetic template-based dialogue summaries, generated by a set of rules from the dialogue states. Then, the dialogue states can be recovered by inversely applying the summary generation rules. We empirically show that our method DS2 outperforms previous works on few-shot DST in MultiWoZ 2.0 and 2.1, in both cross-domain and multi-domain settings. Our method also exhibits vast speedup during both training and inference as it can generate all states at once. Finally, based on our analysis, we discover that the naturalness of the summary templates plays a key role for successful training."}}

However, existing evaluation metrics for MCQ generation, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, focus on the n-gram based similarity of the generated MCQ to the gold sample in the dataset and disregard their educational value. They fail to evaluate the MCQ's ability to assess the student's knowledge of the corresponding target fact. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel automatic evaluation metric, coined Knowledge Dependent Answerability (KDA), which measures the MCQ's answerability given knowledge of the target fact. Specifically, we first show how to measure KDA based on student responses from a human survey. Then, we propose two automatic evaluation metrics, KDA_disc and KDA_cont, that approximate KDA by leveraging pre-trained language models to imitate students' problem-solving behavior. Through our human studies, we show that KDA_disc and KDA_soft have strong correlations with both (1) KDA and (2) usability in an actual classroom setting, labeled by experts. Furthermore, when combined with n-gram based similarity metrics, KDA_disc and KDA_cont are shown to have a strong predictive power for various expert-labeled MCQ quality measures."}}

KLUE is a collection of eight Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including Topic Classification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural LanguageInference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing, Machine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We create all of the datasets from scratch in a principled way. We design the tasks to have diverse formats and each task to be built upon various source corpora that respect copyrights. Also, we propose suitable evaluation metrics and organize annotation protocols in a way to ensure quality. To prevent ethical risks in KLUE, we proactively remove examples reflecting social biases, containing toxic content or personally identifiable information (PII). Along with the benchmark datasets, we release pre-trained language models (PLM) for Korean, KLUE-BERT and KLUE-RoBERTa, and find KLUE-Roberta-large outperforms other baselines including multilingual PLMs and existing open-source Korean PLMs. The fine-tuning recipes are publicly open for anyone to reproduce our baseline result. We believe our work will facilitate future research on cross-lingual as well as Korean language models and the creation of similar resources for other languages. KLUE is available at https://klue-benchmark.com.\n\n"}}

In this paper, we propose to learn a dialogue system that independently parameterizes different dialogue skills, and learns to select and combine each of them through Attention over Parameters (AoP). The experimental results show that this approach achieves competitive performance on a combined dataset of MultiWOZ, In-Car Assistant, and Persona-Chat.

Recent neural conversation models that attempted to generate empathetic responses either focused on conditioning the output to a given emotion, or incorporating the current user emotional state. However, these approaches do not factor in how the user would feel towards the generated response. Hence, in this paper, we propose Sentiment Look-ahead, which is a novel perspective for empathy that models the future user emotional state. In short, Sentiment Look-ahead is a reward function under a reinforcement learning framework that provides a higher reward to the generative model when the generated utterance improves the user's sentiment. We implement and evaluate three different possible implementations of sentiment look-ahead and empirically show that our proposed approach can generate significantly more empathetic, relevant, and fluent responses than other competitive baselines such as multitask learning."}}
