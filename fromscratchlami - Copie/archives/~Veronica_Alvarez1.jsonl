However, backward learning is often prone to a so-called catastrophic forgetting in which a task\u2019s performance gets worse while trying to repeatedly incorporate information from succeeding tasks.  In addition, current lifelong learning techniques are designed for i.i.d. tasks and cannot capture the usual higher similarities between consecutive tasks. This paper presents lifelong learning methods based on minimax risk classifiers (LMRCs) that effectively exploit forward and backward learning and account for time-dependent tasks. In addition, we analytically characterize the increase in effective sample size provided by forward and backward learning in terms of  the tasks\u2019 expected quadratic change. The experimental evaluation shows that LMRCs can result in a significant performance improvement, especially for reduced sample sizes. "}}

Conventional learning techniques adapt to such concept drift accounting for a scalar rate of change by means of a carefully chosen learning rate, forgetting factor, or window size. However, the time changes in common scenarios are multidimensional, i.e., different statistical characteristics often change in a different manner. This paper presents adaptive minimax risk classifiers (AMRCs) that account for multidimensional time changes by means of a multivariate and high-order tracking of the time-varying underlying distribution. In addition, differently from conventional techniques, AMRCs can provide computable tight performance guarantees. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the classification improvement of AMRCs compared to the state-of-the-art and the reliability of the presented performance guarantees."}}

Such relevance has increased even more in recent years due to the integration of renewable energies, electric cars, and microgrids. Conventional load forecasting techniques obtain single-value load forecasts by exploiting consumption patterns of past load demand. However, such techniques cannot assess intrinsic uncertainties in load demand, and cannot capture dynamic changes in consumption patterns. To address these problems, this paper presents a method for probabilistic load forecasting based on the adaptive online learning of hidden Markov models. We propose learning and forecasting techniques with theoretical guarantees, and experimentally assess their performance in multiple scenarios. In particular, we develop adaptive online learning techniques that update model parameters recursively, and sequential prediction techniques that obtain probabilistic forecasts using the most recent parameters. The performance of the method is evaluated using multiple datasets corresponding with regions that have different sizes and display assorted time-varying consumption patterns. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of existing techniques for a wide range of scenarios."}}
