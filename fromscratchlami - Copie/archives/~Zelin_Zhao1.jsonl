Unlike tracking via detected bounding boxes or tracking objects as points, we propose tracking objects as pixel-wise distributions. We instantiate this idea on a transformer-based architecture, P3AFormer, with pixel-wise propagation, prediction, and association. P3AFormer propagates pixel-wise features guided by flow information to pass messages between frames. Furthermore, P3AFormer adopts a meta-architecture to produce multi-scale object feature maps. During inference, a pixel-wise association procedure is proposed to recover object connections through frames based on the pixel-wise prediction. P3AFormer yields 81.2\\% in terms of MOTA on the MOT17 benchmark -- the first among all transformer networks to reach 80\\% MOTA in literature. P3AFormer also outperforms state-of-the-arts on the MOT20 and KITTI benchmarks."}}

Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field (NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D. Besides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the single-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis. The code will be made publicly available."}}

This paper proposes a human&ndash;computer interaction method for remotely manipulating life-size humanoid robots with a new metrics for evaluating motion similarity. First, we establish a motion capture system to acquire the operator&rsquo;s motion data and retarget it to the standard bone model. Secondly, we develop a fast mapping algorithm, by mapping the BVH (BioVision Hierarchy) data collected by the motion capture system to each joint motion angle of the robot to realize the imitated motion control of the humanoid robot. Thirdly, a DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)-based trajectory evaluation method is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the difference between robot trajectory and human motion, and meanwhile, visualization terminals render it more convenient to make comparisons between two different but simultaneous motion systems. We design a complex gesture simulation experiment to verify the feasibility and real-time performance of the control method. The proposed human-in-the-loop imitation control method addresses a prominent non-isostructural retargeting problem between human and robot, enhances robot interaction capability in a more natural way, and improves robot adaptability to uncertain and dynamic environments."}}

We focus on uncovering the underlying atomic events and their relations that lead to the composite events within a noisy temporal data setting. We propose Neural Temporal Logic Programming (Neural TLP) which first learns implicit temporal relations between atomic events and then lifts logic rules for composite events, given only the composite events labels for supervision.

In this paper, we propose routine-augmented policy learning (RAPL), which discovers routines composed of primitive actions from a single demonstration and uses discovered routines to augment policy learning. To discover routines from the demonstration, we first abstract routine candidates by identifying grammar over the demonstrated action trajectory. Then, the best routines measured by length and frequency are selected to form a routine library. We propose to learn policy simultaneously at primitive-level and routine-level with discovered routines, leveraging the temporal structure of routines. Our approach enables imitating expert behavior at multiple temporal scales for imitation learning and promotes reinforcement learning exploration. Extensive experiments on Atari games demonstrate that RAPL improves the state-of-the-art imitation learning method SQIL and reinforcement learning method A2C. Further, we show that discovered routines can generalize to unseen levels and difficulties on the CoinRun benchmark."}}

We extend existing models to leverage these soft programs and scene graphs to train on question answer pairs in an end-to-end manner. Empirical results demonstrate that this differentiable end-to-end program executor is able to maintain state-of-the-art accuracy while being sample and computationally efficient."}}
