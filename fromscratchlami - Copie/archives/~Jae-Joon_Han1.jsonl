Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into several sub-tasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks, centers and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer strategy requires complex postprocessing in both spatial and temporal domains and is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by object-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations, we present Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode all panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and background semantics, with a unified representation called panoptic slots. The coherent spatio-temporal object\u2019s information is retrieved and encoded into the panoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling to localize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner. Finally, the output panoptic slots can be directly\nconverted into the class, mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video. We conduct extensive ablation studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, Cityscapes-VPS (val and test sets) and VIPER (val set), achieving new state-of-the-art performance of 63.7, 63.3 and 56.2 VPQ, respectively."}}

Most methods train STR model in a fully supervised manner which requires large amounts of labeled data. Although synthetic data contributes a lot to STR, it suffers from the real-tosynthetic domain gap the restricts model performance. In this work, we aim to boost STR models by leveraging both synthetic data and the numerous real unlabeled images, exempting human annotation cost thoroughly. A robust consistency regularization based semi-supervised framework is proposed for STR, which can effectively solve the instability issue due to domain inconsistency between synthetic and real images. A character-level consistency regularization is designed to mitigate the misalignment between characters in sequence recognition. Extensive experiments on standard text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It can steadily improve existing STR models, and boost an STR model to achieve new state-of-the-art results. To our best knowledge, this is the first consistency regularization based framework that applies successfully to STR."}}

In this paper, an accurate facial landmark detector is proposed based on cascaded transformers. We formulate facial landmark detection as a coordinate regression task such that the model can be trained end-to-end. With self-attention in transformers, our model can inherently exploit the structured relationships between landmarks, which would benefit landmark detection under challenging conditions such as large pose and occlusion. During cascaded refinement, our model is able to extract the most relevant image features around the target landmark for coordinate prediction, based on deformable attention mechanism, thus bringing more accurate alignment. In addition, we propose a novel decoder that refines image features and landmark positions simultaneously. With few parameter increasing, the detection performance improves further. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on several standard facial landmark detection benchmarks, and shows good generalization ability in cross-dataset evaluation."}}

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical regularization which preserves the semantic structure of a sample distribution. At the same time, this regularization promotes diversity by imposing distance between parameter vectors enlarged within semantic structures. To generate evenly distributed parameters, we constrain them to lie on \\emph{hierarchical hyperspheres}. Evenly distributed parameters are considered to be less redundant. To define hierarchical parameter space, we propose to reformulate the topology space with multiple hypersphere space. On each hypersphere space, the projection parameter is defined by two individual parameters. Since maximizing groupwise pairwise distance between points on hypersphere is nontrivial (generalized Thomson problem), we propose a new discrete metric integrated with continuous angle metric. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CUB200-2011, and Stanford Cars), our proposed method shows improved generalization performance,  especially when the number of super-classes is larger."}}

However, decreasing bit-widths with quantization generally yields drastically degraded accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose to learn to quantize activations and weights via a trainable quantizer that transforms and discretizes them. Specifically, we parameterize the quantization intervals and obtain their optimal values by directly minimizing the task loss of the network. This quantization-interval-learning (QIL) allows the quantized networks to maintain the accuracy of the full-precision (32-bit) networks with bit-width as low as 4-bit and minimize the accuracy degeneration with further bit-width reduction (i.e., 3 and 2-bit). Moreover, our quantizer can be trained on a heterogeneous dataset, and thus can be used to quantize pretrained networks without access to their training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our trainable quantizer on ImageNet dataset with various network architectures such as ResNet-18, -34 and AlexNet, on which it outperforms existing methods to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy."}}

Bad GAN learns a classifier with bad samples distributed on complement of the support of the input data. But Bad GAN needs additional architectures, a generator and a density estimation model, which involves huge computation and memory consumption cost. VAT is another good semi-supervised learning algorithm, which\nutilizes unlabeled data to improve the invariance of the classifier with respect to perturbation of inputs.  In this study, we propose a new method by combining the ideas of Bad GAN and VAT. The proposed method generates bad samples of high-quality by use of the adversarial training used in VAT. We give theoretical explanations why the adversarial training is good at both generating bad samples and semi-supervised learning. An advantage of the proposed method is to achieve the competitive performances with much fewer computations. We demonstrate advantages our method by various experiments with well known benchmark image datasets."}}

While lots of progress have been made in this field, current state-of-the-art methods still fail to extract real effective feature and restore accurate score map, especially for those facial parts which have large variations of deformation and fairly similar appearance, e.g. mouth, eyes and thin eyebrows. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise face parsing method called Residual Encoder Decoder Network (RED-Net), which combines a feature-rich encoder-decoder framework with adaptive prior mechanism. Our encoder-decoder framework extracts feature with ResNet and decodes the feature by elaborately fusing the residual architectures in to deconvolution. This framework learns more effective feature comparing to that learnt by decoding with interpolation or classic deconvolution operations. To overcome the appearance ambiguity between facial parts, an adaptive prior mechanism is proposed in term of the decoder prediction confidence, allowing refining the final result. The experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts significantly, achieving improvements of F-measure from 0.854 to 0.905 on Helen dataset, and pixel accuracy from 95.12% to 97.59% on the LFW dataset. In particular, convincing qualitative examples show that our method parses eye, eyebrow, and lip regins more accurately."}}
