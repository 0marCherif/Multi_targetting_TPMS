In this line of work, a diffusion model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, FrameDiff, for learning the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods. We find our samples are capable of generalizing beyond any known protein structure."}}

They consist of a noising process destroying the data and a backward stage defined as the time-reversal of the noising diffusion. Building on their success, diffusion models have recently been extended to the Riemannian manifold setting. Yet, these Riemannian diffusion models require geodesics to be defined for all times. While this setting encompasses many important applications, it does not include manifolds defined via a set of inequality constraints, which are ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as robotics and protein design. In this work, we introduce two methods to bridge this gap. First, we design a noising process based on the logarithmic barrier metric induced by the inequality constraints. Second, we introduce a noising process based on the reflected Brownian motion. As existing diffusion model techniques cannot be applied in this setting, we derive new tools to define such models in our framework. We empirically demonstrate the applicability of our methods to a number of synthetic and real-world tasks, including the constrained conformational modelling of protein backbones and robotic arms."}}

Previous data augmentation methods have generally assumed independence between the original input and the transformation applied to that input. This can be highly restrictive, as the invariances that the augmentations are based on are themselves often highly input dependent; e.g., we can change a leaf from green to yellow while maintaining its label, but not a lime. InstaAug instead allows for input dependency by introducing an invariance module that maps inputs to tailored transformation distributions. It can be simultaneously trained alongside the downstream model in a fully end-to-end manner, or separately learned for a pre-trained model. We empirically demonstrate that InstaAug learns meaningful input-dependent augmentations for a wide range of transformation classes, which in turn provides better performance on both supervised and self-supervised tasks."}}
