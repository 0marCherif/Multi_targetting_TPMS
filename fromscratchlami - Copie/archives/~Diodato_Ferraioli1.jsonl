Recently, huge interest has been devoted to the design of mechanisms for imperfectly rational agents, i.e., mechanisms for which agents are able to easily grasp that there is no action different from following the protocol that would satisfy their interests better. This work has culminated in the definition of Obviously Strategyproof (OSP) Mechanisms, that have been shown to capture the incentives of agents without contingent reasoning skills. Without an understanding of the algorithmic nature of OSP mechanisms, it is hard to assess how well these mechanisms can satisfy the goals of the planner. For the case of binary allocation problems and agents whose private type is a single number, recent work has shown that a generalization of greedy completely characterizes OSP. In this work, we strengthen the connection between greedy and OSP by providing a characterization of OSP mechanisms for all optimization problems involving these single-parameter agents. Specifically, we prove that OSP mechanisms must essentially work as follows: they either greedily look for agents with ``better'' types and allocate them larger outcomes; or reverse greedily look for agents with ``worse'' types and allocate them smaller outcomes; or, finally, split the domain of agents in ``good'' and ``bad'' types, and subsequently proceed in a reverse greedy fashion for the former and greedily for the latter. We further demonstrate how to use this characterization to give bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms for the well known scheduling related machines problem."}}

We here want to study the relationship between the approximation guarantee of incentive-compatible mechanisms and the degree of rationality of the agents, intuitively measured in terms of the number of contingencies that they can handle in their reasoning. We weaken the definition of OSP to accommodate for cleverer agents and study the trade-off between approximation and agents\u2019 rationality for two paradigmatic problems: machine scheduling and facility location. We prove that, for both problems, \u201cgood\u201d approximations are possible if and only if the agents\u2019 rationality allows for a significant number of contingencies to be considered, thus showing that OSP is not too restrictive a notion of bounded rationality from the point of view of approximation."}}

In particular, AI will enable the optimization of more and more intricate economic settings, in which multiple different activities need to be jointly automated. This is the case of, e.g., Google Hotel Ads and Tripadvisor, where auctions are used to display ads of similar products or services together with their prices. As in classical ad auctions, the ads are ranked depending on the advertisers' bids, whereas, differently from classical settings, ads are displayed together with their prices, so as to provide a direct comparison among them. This dramatically affects users' behavior, as well as the properties of ad auctions. We show that, in such settings, social welfare maximization can be achieved by means of a direct-revelation mechanism that jointly optimizes, in polynomial time, the ads allocation and the advertisers' prices to be displayed with them. However, in practice it is unlikely that advertisers allow the mechanism to choose prices on their behalf. Indeed, in commonly-adopted mechanisms, ads allocation and price optimization are decoupled, so that the advertisers optimize prices and bids, while the mechanism does so for the allocation, once prices and bids are given. We investigate how this decoupling affects the efficiency of mechanisms. In particular, we study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) of indirect-revelation mechanisms with both VCG and GSP payments, showing that the PoS for the revenue may be unbounded even with two slots, and the PoA for the social welfare may be as large as the number of slots. Nevertheless, we show that, under some assumptions, simple modifications to the indirect-revelation mechanism with VCG payments achieve a PoS of 1 for the revenue."}}

In particular, AI will allow the optimization of more and more intricate economic settings in which multiple different activities can be automated jointly. A relatively recent example is that one of ad auctions in which similar products or services are displayed together with their price, thus merging advertising and pricing in a unique website. This is the case, e.g., of Google Hotel Ads and TripAdvisor. More precisely, as in a classical ad auction, the ranking of the ads depends on the advertisers' bids, while, differently from classical ad auctions, the price is displayed together with the ad, so as to provide a direct comparison among the prices and thus dramatically affect the behavior of the users. This paper investigates how displaying prices and ads together conditions the properties of the main economic mechanisms such as VCG and GSP. Initially, we focus on the direct-revelation mechanism, showing that prices are chosen by the mechanisms once given the advertisers' reports. We also provide an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal allocation given the private information reported by the advertisers. Then, with both VCG and GSP payments, we show the inefficiency in terms of Price of Anarchy (PoA) and Stability (PoS) over the social welfare and mechanism's revenue when the advertisers choose the prices. The main results show that, with both VCG and GSP, PoS over the revenue may be unbounded even with two slots, while PoA over the social welfare may be as large as the number of slots. Finally, we show that, under some assumptions, simple modifications to VCG and GSP allow us to obtain a better PoS over the revenue."}}
