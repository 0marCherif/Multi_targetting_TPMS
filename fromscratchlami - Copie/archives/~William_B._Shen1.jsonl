However, manually creating or re-creating real-world-like environments is difficult, expensive, and not scalable. Recent generative model techniques have shown promising progress to address such challenges by learning 3D assets using only plentiful 2D images -- but still suffer limitations as they leverage either human-curated image datasets or renderings from manually-created synthetic 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce GINA-3D, a generative model that uses real-world driving data from camera and LiDAR sensors to create realistic 3D implicit neural assets of diverse vehicles and pedestrians. Compared to the existing image datasets, the real-world driving setting poses new challenges due to occlusions, lighting-variations and long-tail distributions. GINA-3D tackles these challenges by decoupling representation learning and generative modeling into two stages with a learned tri-plane latent structure, inspired by recent advances in generative modeling of images. To evaluate our approach, we construct a large-scale object-centric dataset containing over 520K images of vehicles and pedestrians from the Waymo Open Dataset, and a new set of 80K images of long-tail instances such as construction equipment, garbage trucks, and cable cars. We compare our model with existing approaches and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in quality and diversity for both generated images and geometries."}}

However, previous approaches to exoskeleton perception greatly simplify the problem to specific types of environments, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we propose the challenging and novel problem of predicting human-scene collisions for diverse environments from multi-view egocentric RGB videos captured from an exoskeleton. By classifying which body joints will collide with the environment and predicting a collision region heatmap that localizes potential collisions in the environment, we aim to develop an exoskeleton perception system that generalizes to complex real-world scenes and provides actionable outputs for downstream control. We propose COPILOT, a video transformer-based model that performs both collision prediction and localization simultaneously, leveraging multi-view video inputs via a proposed joint space-time-viewpoint attention operation. To train and evaluate the model, we build a synthetic data generation framework to simulate virtual humans moving in photo-realistic 3D environments. This framework is then used to establish a dataset consisting of 8.6M egocentric RGBD frames to enable future work on the problem. Extensive experiments suggest that our model achieves promising performance and generalizes to unseen scenes as well as real world. We apply COPILOT to a downstream collision avoidance task, and successfully reduce collision cases by 29% on unseen scenes using a simple closed-loop control algorithm."}}

Existing methods alleviate performance drop via domain alignment in a shared space and assume that the mapping from the aligned space to the output is transferable. However, the novel content induced by viewpoint changes may nullify such a space for effective alignments, thus resulting in negative adaptation. Our method works without aligning any statistics of the images between the two domains. Instead, it utilizes a novel attention-based view transformation network trained only on color images to hallucinate the semantic images for the target. Despite the lack of supervision, the view transformation network can still generalize to semantic images thanks to the induced \u201cinformation transport\u201d bias. Furthermore, to resolve ambiguities in converting the semantic images to semantic labels, we treat the view transformation network as a functional representation of an unknown mapping implied by the color images and propose functional label hallucination to generate pseudo-labels with uncertainties in the target domains. Our method surpasses baselines built on state-of-the-art correspondence estimation and view synthesis methods. Moreover, it outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods that utilize self-training and adversarial domain alignments. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available."}}

We introduce ACID, an action-conditional visual dynamics model for volumetric deformable objects based on structured implicit neural representations. ACID integrates two new techniques: implicit representations for action-conditional dynamics and geodesics-based contrastive learning. To represent deformable dynamics from partial RGB-D observations, we learn implicit representations of occupancy and flow-based forward dynamics. To accurately identify state change under large non-rigid deformations, we learn a correspondence embedding field through a novel geodesics-based contrastive loss. To evaluate our approach, we develop a simulation framework for manipulating complex deformable shapes in realistic scenes and a benchmark containing over 17,000 action trajectories with six types of plush toys and 78 variants. Our model achieves the best performance in geometry, correspondence, and dynamics predictions over existing approaches. The ACID dynamics models are successfully employed to goal-conditioned deformable manipulation tasks, resulting in a 30% increase in task success rate over the strongest baseline. Furthermore, we apply the simulation-trained ACID model directly to real-world objects and show success in manipulating them into target configurations.
