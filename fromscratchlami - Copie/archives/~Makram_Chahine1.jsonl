However, it is difficult to guarantee stability and robustness for these systems since they are often exposed to unstructured, high-dimensional, and complex observation spaces (e.g., autonomous driving from a stream of pixel inputs). We propose to leverage control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to equip end-to-end vision-based policies with stability properties and introduce stability attention in CLFs (att-CLFs) to tackle environmental changes and improve learning flexibility. We also present an uncertainty propagation technique that is tightly integrated into att-CLFs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of att-CLFs via comparison with classical CLFs, model predictive control, and vanilla end-to-end learning in a photo-realistic simulator and on a real full-scale autonomous vehicle."}}

LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structured state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, improves generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32\\% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

In this paper, we introduce a safety guaranteed learning framework for vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving. To this end, we design a learning system equipped with differentiable control barrier functions (dCBFs) that is trained end-to-end by gradient descent. Our models are composed of conventional neural network architectures and dCBFs. They are interpretable at scale, achieve great test performance under limited training data, and are safety guaranteed in a series of autonomous driving scenarios such as lane keeping and obstacle avoidance. We evaluated our framework in a sim-to-real environment, and tested on a real autonomous car, achieving safe lane following and obstacle avoidance via Augmented Reality (AR) and real parked vehicles."}}

A parallel-autonomous system acts as a guardian that significantly enhances the robustness and safety of flight operations in challenging circumstances. Here, we propose an air-guardian concept that facilitates cooperation between an artificial pilot agent and a parallel end-to-end neural control system. Our vision-based air-guardian system combines a causal continuous-depth neural network model with a cooperation layer to enable parallel autonomy between a pilot agent and a control system based on perceived differences in their attention profile. The attention profiles are obtained by computing the networks' saliency maps (feature importance) through the VisualBackProp algorithm. The guardian agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a fixed-wing aircraft simulated environment. When the attention profile of the pilot and guardian agents align, the pilot makes control decisions. If the attention map of the pilot and the guardian do not align, the air-guardian makes interventions and takes over the control of the aircraft. We show that our attention-based air-guardian system can balance the trade-off between its level of involvement in the flight and the pilot's expertise and attention. We demonstrate the effectivness of our methods in simulated flight scenarios with a fixed-wing aircraft and on a real drone platform."}}
