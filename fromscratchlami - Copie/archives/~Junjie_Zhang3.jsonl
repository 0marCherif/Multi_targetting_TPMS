Due to the diverse contents and complex styles, some images can be challenging to recognise when neglecting the context. Images with the similar metadata, such as 'relevant topics and textual descriptions', 'common friends of users' and 'nearby locations', form a neighbourhood for each image, which can be used to assist the annotation. In this paper, we propose a Metadata Neighbourhood Graph Co-Attention Network (MangoNet) to model the correlations between each target image and its neighbours. To accurately capture the visual clues from the neighbourhood, a co-attention mechanism is introduced to embed the target image and its neighbours as graph nodes, while the graph edges capture the node pair correlations. By reasoning on the neighbourhood graph, we obtain the graph representation to help annotate the target image. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}

These comments can be a description of the image, or some objects, attributes, scenes in it, which are normally used as the user-provided tags. However, it is well-known that user-provided tags are incomplete and imprecise to some extent. Directly using them can damage the performance of related applications, such as the image annotation and retrieval. In this paper, we propose to learn an image annotation model and refine the user-provided tags simultaneously in a weakly-supervised manner. The deep neural network is utilized as the image feature learning and backbone annotation model, while visual consistency, semantic dependency, and user-error sparsity are introduced as the constraints at the batch level to alleviate the tag noise. Therefore, our model is highly flexible and stable to handle large-scale image sets. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Towards this end, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework based on three new intermediate rewards, namely goal-achieved, progressive and informativeness that encourage the generation of succinct questions, which in turn uncover valuable information towards the overall goal. By directly optimizing for questions that work quickly towards fulfilling the overall goal, we avoid the tendency of existing methods to generate long series of inane queries that add little value. We evaluate our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset and show that the resulting questions can help a standard \u2018Guesser\u2019 identify a specific object in an image at a much higher success rate."}}
