Among recently proposed methods, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10/100, while having difficulty scaling to ImageNet-1k dataset due to the large memory requirement when performing unrolled gradient computation through back-propagation. Surprisingly, we show that there exists a procedure to exactly calculate the gradient of the trajectory matching loss  with constant memory requirement (irrelevant to the number of unrolled steps). With this finding, the proposed memory-efficient trajectory matching method can easily scale to ImageNet-1K with roughly 6x memory reduction while introducing only around 2% runtime overhead than original MTT. Further, we find that assigning soft labels for synthetic images is crucial for the performance when scaling to larger number of categories (e.g., 1,000) and propose a novel soft label version of trajectory matching that facilities better aligning of model training trajectories on large datasets. \nThe proposed algorithm not only surpasses previous SOTA on ImageNet-1K under extremely low IPCs (Images Per Class), but also for the first time enables us to scale up to 50 IPCs on ImageNet-1K. Our method (TESLA) achieves 27.9% testing accuracy, a remarkable +18.2% margin over prior arts."}}

As the size of datasets contemporary machine learning models rely on becomes increasingly large, condensation methods become a prominent direction for accelerating network training and reducing data storage.

The lack of a systematic way to evaluate and compare condensation methods not only hinders our understanding of existing techniques, but also discourages practical usage of the synthesized datasets. This work provides the first large-scale standardized benchmark on Dataset Condensation. It consists of a suite of evaluations to comprehensively reflect the generability and effectiveness of condensation methods through the lens of their generated dataset. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current condensation methods, and report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development. The benchmark library, including evaluators, baseline methods, and generated datasets, is open-sourced to facilitate future research and application."}}
