Specifically, having observed that the bottleneck of this task lies in lacking reliable and informative samples to train the detector, we introduce a novel, simple, yet effective `Augment and Criticize' framework that explores abundant informative samples from unlabeled data for learning more robust detection models. In the `Augment' stage, we present the Augmentation-based Prediction aGgregation (APG), which aggregates detections from various automatically learned augmented views to improve the robustness of pseudo label generation. Since not all pseudo labels from APG are beneficially informative, the subsequent `Criticize' phase is presented. In particular, we introduce the Critical Retraining Strategy (CRS) that, unlike simply filtering pseudo labels using a fixed threshold (e.g., classification score) as in 2D semi-supervised tasks, leverages a learnable network to evaluate the contribution of unlabeled images at different training timestamps. This way, the noisy samples prohibitive to model evolution could be effectively suppressed. To validate our framework, we apply it to MonoDLE and MonoFlex. The two new detectors, dubbed 3DSeMo_DLE and 3DSeMo_FLEX, achieve state-of-the-art results with remarkable improvements for over 3.5% AP_3D/BEV (Easy) on KITTI, showing its effectiveness and generality. Code and models will be released."}}

Although deep SR networks have achieved extraordinary success, we are still unaware of their working mechanisms. Specifically, whether SR networks can learn semantic information, or just perform complex mapping function? What hinders SR networks from generalizing to real-world data? These questions not only raise our curiosity, but also influence SR network development. In this paper, we make the primary attempt to answer the above fundamental questions. After comprehensively analyzing the feature representations (via dimensionality reduction and visualization), we successfully discover the distinctive ``semantics'' in SR networks, i.e., deep degradation representations (DDR), which relate to image degradation instead of image content. We show that a well-trained deep SR network is naturally a good descriptor of degradation information. Our experiments also reveal two key factors (adversarial learning and global residual) that influence the extraction of such semantics. We further apply DDR in several interesting applications (such as distortion identification, blind SR and generalization evaluation) and achieve promising results, demonstrating the correctness and effectiveness of our findings."}}

However, existing efforts mainly focus on fusing and enhancing features generated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The potential of Transformer in representation learning remains under-explored. In this paper, we aim to further unleash the power of Transformer by proposing a simple yet efficient fully-attentional tracker, dubbed SwinTrack, within classic Siamese framework. In particular, both representation learning and feature fusion in SwinTrack leverage the Transformer architecture, enabling better feature interactions for tracking than pure CNN or hybrid CNN-Transformer frameworks. Besides, to further enhance robustness, we present a novel motion token that embeds historical target trajectory to improve tracking by providing temporal context. Our motion token is lightweight with negligible computation but brings clear gains. In our thorough experiments, SwinTrack exceeds existing approaches on multiple benchmarks. Particularly, on the challenging LaSOT, SwinTrack sets a new record with 0.713 SUC score. It also achieves SOTA results on other benchmarks. We expect SwinTrack to serve as a solid baseline for Transformer tracking and facilitate future research. Our codes and results are released at https://github.com/LitingLin/SwinTrack."}}

Recently, significant breakthrough has been made in multi-view 3D detection tasks. However, the unprecedented detection performance of these vision BEV (bird's-eye-view) detection models is accompanied with enormous parameters and computation, which make them unaffordable on edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a structured knowledge distillation framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of modern vision-only BEV detection models. The proposed framework mainly includes: (a) spatial-temporal distillation which distills teacher knowledge of information fusion from different timestamps and views, (b) BEV response distillation which distills teacher response to different pillars, and (c) weight-inheriting which solves the problem of inconsistent inputs between students and teacher in modern transformer architectures. Experimental results show that our method leads to an average improvement of 2.16 mAP and 2.27 NDS on the nuScenes benchmark, outperforming multiple baselines by a large margin."}}

However, the inherent differences and relations between detection and re-identification (ReID) are unconsciously overlooked because of treating them as two isolated tasks in the one-shot tracking paradigm. This leads to inferior performance compared with existing two-stage methods. In this paper, we first dissect the reasoning process for these two tasks, which reveals that the competition between them inevitably would destroy task-dependent representations learning. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel reciprocal network (REN) with a self-relation and cross-relation design so that to impel each branch to better learn task-dependent representations. The proposed model aims to alleviate the deleterious tasks competition, meanwhile improve the cooperation between detection and ReID. Furthermore, we introduce a scale-aware attention network (SAAN) that prevents semantic level misalignment to improve the association capability of ID embeddings. By integrating the two delicately designed networks into a one-shot online MOT system, we construct a strong MOT tracker, namely CSTrack. Our tracker achieves the state-of-the-art performance on MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 datasets, without other bells and whistles. Moreover, CSTrack is efficient and runs at 16.4 FPS on a single modern GPU, and its lightweight version even runs at 34.6 FPS.

However, current one-shot trackers solely rely on single-frame detections to predict candidate bounding boxes, which may be unreliable when facing disastrous visual degradation, e.g., motion blur, occlusions. Once a target bounding box is mistakenly classified as background by the detector, the temporal consistency of its corresponding tracklet will be no longer maintained. In this paper, we set out to restore the bounding boxes misclassified as ``fake background'' by proposing a re-check network. The re-check network innovatively expands the role of ID embedding from data association to motion forecasting by effectively propagating previous tracklets to the current frame with a small overhead. Note that the propagation results are yielded by an independent and efficient embedding search, preventing the model from over-relying on detection results. Eventually, it helps to reload the ``fake background'' and repair the broken tracklets. Building on a strong baseline CSTrack, we construct a new one-shot tracker and achieve favorable gains by 70.7 \u27a1 76.4, 70.6 \u27a1 76.3 MOTA on MOT16 and MOT17, respectively.

Specifically, having observed that de facto frameworks perform feature matching simply using the outputs from backbone for target localization, there is no direct feedback from the matching module to the backbone network, especially the shallow layers. More concretely, only the matching module can directly access the target information (in the reference frame), while the representation learning of candidate frame is blind to the reference target. As a consequence, the accumulation effect of target-irrelevant interference in the shallow stages may degrade the feature quality of deeper layers. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different angle by conducting multiple branch-wise interactions inside the Siamese-like backbone networks (InBN). At the core of InBN is a general interaction modeler (GIM) that injects the prior knowledge of reference image to different stages of the backbone network, leading to better target-perception and robust distractor-resistance of candidate feature representation with negligible computation cost. The proposed GIM module and InBN mechanism are general and applicable to different backbone types including CNN and Transformer for improvements, as evidenced by our extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks. In particular, the CNN version (based on SiamCAR) improves the baseline with 3.2/6.9 absolute gains of SUC on LaSOT/TNL2K, respectively. The Transformer version obtains SUC scores of 65.7/52.0 on LaSOT/TNL2K, which are on par with recent state of the arts. Code and models will be released."}}
