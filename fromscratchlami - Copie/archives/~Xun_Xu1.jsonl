Existing approaches towards anomaly detection~(AD) often rely on substantial amount of anomaly-free samples to train representation and density models. Nevertheless, large anomaly-free datasets may not always be available before inference stage and this requires building an anomaly detection framework with only a handful of normal samples, a.k.a. few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD). We propose two techniques to address the challenges in FSAD. First, we employ a  model pretrained on large source dataset to initialize model weights. To ameliorate the covariate shift between source and target domains, we adopt contrastive training on the few-shot target domain data. Second, to encourage learning representations suitable for downstream AD, we further incorporate cross-instance pairs to increase tightness within normal sample cluster and better separation between normal and synthesized negative samples. Extensive evaluations on six few-shot anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Test-time training (TTT) emerges as a solution to this adaptation under a realistic scenario where access to full source domain data is not available and instant inference on target domain is required. Despite many efforts into TTT, there is a confusion over the experimental settings, thus leading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions and categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols, we adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which we further develop a test-time anchored clustering (TTAC) approach to enable stronger test-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and target domain and match the target clusters to the source ones to improve generalization. Pseudo label filtering and iterative updating are developed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of anchored clustering. We demonstrate that under all TTT protocols TTAC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on six TTT datasets. We hope this work will provide a fair benchmarking of TTT methods and future research should be compared within respective protocols. A demo code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/TTAC."}}

Given multiple deep views of the same input, DiCoM encourages a negative correlation among the views' predictions on labeled data, while simultaneously enforces their agreement on unlabeled data. DiCoM can utilize either multi-network or multi-branch architectures to make a trade-off between computational cost and modeling performance. Under realistic evaluation setups, DiCoM outperforms competing methods on tabular and image data. Our ablation studies confirm the importance of having both consistency and diversity."}}

The success of existing approaches is attributed to deep network design and large amount of labelled training data, where the latter is assumed to be always available. However, obtaining 3d point cloud segmentation labels is often very costly in practice. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised point cloud segmentation approach which requires only a tiny fraction of points to be labelled in the training stage. This is made possible by learning gradient approximation and exploitation of additional spatial and color smoothness constraints. Experiments are done on three public datasets with different degrees of weak supervision. In particular, our proposed method can produce results that are close to and sometimes even better than its fully supervised counterpart with 10\u00d7 fewer labels. Our code is available at the project website.\n.\n"}}

Recent advancements show that adversarially robust generalization requires a large amount of labeled data for training. If annotation becomes a burden, can unlabeled data help bridge the gap? In this paper, we propose ARMOURED, an adversarially robust training method based on semi-supervised learning that consists of two components. The first component applies multi-view learning to simultaneously optimize multiple independent networks and utilizes unlabeled data to enforce labeling consistency. The second component reduces adversarial transferability among the networks via diversity regularizers inspired by determinantal point processes and entropy maximization. Experimental results show that under small perturbation budgets, ARMOURED is robust against strong adaptive adversaries. Notably, ARMOURED does not rely on generating adversarial samples during training. When used in combination with adversarial training, ARMOURED yields competitive performance with the state-of-the-art adversarially-robust benchmarks on SVHN and outperforms them on CIFAR-10, while offering higher clean accuracy."}}

Many larger and deeper CNNs have been proposed with promising performance, such as AlexNet, VggNet, GoogLeNet and ResNet. However, these models are not practical for the embedded/mobile devices. Recently, MobileNets and ShuffleNets have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters, yielding lightweight models. However, their representation has been weakened because of the adoption of depth-wise separable convolution. In this work, we investigate the limits of compact model for small-scale image and propose an extremely Compact yet efficient Cascade Context-based Age Estimation model(C3AE). This model possesses only 1/9 and 1/2000 parameters compared with MobileNets/ShuffleNets and VggNet, while achieves competitive performance. In particular, we re-define age estimation problem by two-points representation, which is implemented by a cascade model. Moreover, to fully utilize the facial context information, multi-branch CNN network is proposed to aggregate multi-scale context. Experiments are carried out on three age estimation datasets. The state-of-the-art performance on compact model has been achieved with a relatively large margin."}}

Even when we are confronted with a general scene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion segmentation still suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this paper. The full potential of the fundamental matrix approach could only be realized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography model. From these considerations, we propose a multi-view spectral clustering framework that synergistically combines multiple models together. We show that the performance can be substantially improved in this way. We perform extensive testing on existing motion segmentation datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of them; we also put forth a more realistic and challenging dataset adapted from the KITTI benchmark, containing real-world effects such as strong perspectives and strong forward translations not seen in the traditional datasets."}}

This is achieved by establishing a mapping connecting low-level features and a semantic description of the label space, referred as visual-semantic mapping, on auxiliary data. Re-using the learned mapping to project target videos into an embedding space thus allows novel-classes to be recognised by nearest neighbour inference. However, existing ZSL methods suffer from auxiliary-target domain shift intrinsically induced by assuming the same mapping for the disjoint auxiliary and target classes. This compromises the generalisation accuracy of ZSL recognition on the target data. In this work, we improve the ability of ZSL to generalise across this domain shift in both model- and data-centric ways by formulating a visual-semantic mapping with better generalisation properties and a dynamic data re-weighting method to prioritise auxiliary data that are relevant to the target classes. Specifically: (1) We introduce a multi-task visual-semantic mapping to improve generalisation by constraining the semantic mapping parameters to lie on a low-dimensional manifold, (2) We explore prioritised data augmentation by expanding the pool of auxiliary data with additional instances weighted by relevance to the target domain. The proposed new model is applied to the challenging zero-shot action recognition problem to demonstrate its advantages over existing ZSL models."}}
