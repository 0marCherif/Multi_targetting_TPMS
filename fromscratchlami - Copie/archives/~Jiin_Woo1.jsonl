We consider a practical scenario when the information of cascade samples are partially observed in the independent cascade (IC) model. For the graph learning problem, we propose an efficient algorithm that solves a localized version of computationally-intractable maximum likelihood estimation through approximations in both temporal and spatial aspects. Our algorithm iterates the operations of recovering missing time logs and inferring graph connectivity, and thereby progressively improves the inference quality. We study the sample complexity, which is the number of required cascade samples to meet a given inference quality, and show that it is asymptotically close to a lower bound, thus near-order-optimal in terms of the number of nodes. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using five real-world social networks, whose size ranges from 20 to 900, and demonstrate that our algorithm performs better than other competing algorithms in terms of accuracy while maintaining fast running time."}}

We consider the case when respondents may not always be truthful and some cost is taken for each query. Our goal is to quantify the necessary and sufficient budgets to achieve the detection probability $1-\\delta$ for any given $0<\\delta<1.$ To this end, we study two types of algorithms: adaptive and non-adaptive ones, each of which corresponds to whether we adaptively select the next respondents based on the answers of the previous respondents or not. We first provide the information theoretic lower bounds for the necessary budgets in both algorithm types. In terms of the sufficient budgets, we propose two practical estimation algorithms, each of non-adaptive and adaptive types, and for each algorithm, we quantitatively analyze the budget which ensures $1-\\delta$ detection accuracy. This theoretical analysis not only quantifies the budgets needed by practical estimation algorithms achieving a given target detection accuracy in finding the diffusion source, but also enables us to quantitatively characterize the amount of extra budget required in non-adaptive type of estimation, refereed to as {\\em adaptivity gap}. We validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world social network topologies."}}

It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, i.e., finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31% for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks \u201cAre you the rumor source?\u201d or \u201cWho tells you the rumor?\u201d that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queriees can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance.
