Previous TTA methods have a common limitation of using a fixed learning rate for all the test samples.

To address this problem, we propose a novel dynamic learning rate adjustment method for test-time adaptation, called DLTTA, which dynamically modulates the amount of weights update for each test image to account for the differences in their distribution shift. Specifically, our DLTTA is equipped with a memory bank based estimation scheme to effectively measure the discrepancy of a given test sample. Based on this estimated discrepancy, a dynamic learning rate adjustment strategy is then developed to achieve a suitable degree of adaptation for each test sample. The effectiveness and general applicability of our DLTTA is extensively demonstrated on three tasks including retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) segmentation, histopathological image classification, and prostate 3D MRI segmentation. Our method achieves effective and fast test-time adaptation with consistent performance improvement over current state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods.

The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client) and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss. Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and segmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent state-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior.

It is difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve optimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of medical data from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem becomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients outside the FL with new distributions not presented during federated training. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for critical medical tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL (IOP-FL). Our inside personalization is achieved by a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the local adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients for common knowledge and local gradients for client-specific optimization. Moreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the global model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize a new model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing scheme inspired by the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically incorporate the models, given the distribution information conveyed by the test data. Our extensive experimental results on two medical image segmentation tasks present significant improvements over SOTA methods on both inside and outside personalization, demonstrating the great potential of our IOP-FL scheme for clinical practice.

In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging problem of class imbalanced semi-supervised FL (imFed-Semi), which allows all clients to have only unlabeled data while the server just has a small amount of labeled data. This imFed-Semi problem is addressed by a novel dynamic bank learning scheme, which improves client training by exploiting class proportion information. This scheme consists of two parts, i.e., the dynamic bank construction to distill various class proportions for each local client, and the sub-bank classification to impose the local model to learn different class proportions. We evaluate our approach on two public real-world medical datasets, including the intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis with 25,000 CT slices and skin lesion diagnosis with 10,015 dermoscopy images. The effectiveness of our method has been validated with significant performance improvements (7.61% and 4.69%) compared with the second-best on the accuracy, as well as comprehensive analytical studies.

Recently, federated learning (FL), an emerging machine learning paradigm to train a global model from multiple decentralized clients without compromising data privacy, brings new challenges, also new possibilities, to DG. In the FL scenario, many existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG methods become ineffective, because they require the centralization of data from different domains during training. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method for image recognition under federated learning through cross-client style transfer (CCST) without exchanging data samples. Our CCST method can lead to more uniform distributions of source clients, and thus make each local model learn to fit the image styles of all the clients to avoid the different model biases. Two types of style (single image style and overall domain style) with corresponding mechanisms are proposed to be chosen according to different scenarios. Our style representation is exceptionally lightweight and can hardly be used for the reconstruction of the dataset. The level of diversity is also flexible to be controlled with a hyper-parameter. Our method outperforms recent SOTA DG methods on two DG benchmarks (PACS, OfficeHome) and a large-scale medical image dataset (Camelyon17) in the FL setting. Last but not least, our method is orthogonal to many classic DG methods, achieving additive performance by combined utilization."}}

In this work, we propose to tackle this problem from a novel causal perspective. Specifically, we form a training structural causal model (SCM) to explain the challenges of model generalization in a distributed learning paradigm. Based on this, we present a simple yet effective method using test-specific and momentum tracked batch normalization (TsmoBN) to generalize FL models to testing clients. We give a causal analysis by formulating another testing SCM and demonstrate that the key factor in TsmoBN is the test-specific statistics (i.e., mean and variance) of features. Such statistics can be seen as a surrogate variable for causal intervention. In addition, by considering generalization bounds in FL, we show that our TsmoBN method can reduce divergence between training and testing feature distributions, which achieves a lower generalization gap than standard model testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements for unseen client generalization on three datasets with various types of distribution shifts and numbers of clients. It is worth noting that our proposed approach can be flexibly applied to different state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms and is orthogonal to existing domain generalization methods. "}}
