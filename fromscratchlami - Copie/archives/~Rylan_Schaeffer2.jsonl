This drop in test error flies against classical learning theory on overfitting and has arguably underpinned the success of large models in machine learning. This non-monotonic behavior of test loss depends on the number of data, the dimensionality of the data and the number of model parameters. Here, we briefly describe double descent, then provide an explanation of why double descent occurs in an informal and approachable manner, requiring only familiarity with linear algebra and introductory probability. We provide visual intuition using polynomial regression, then mathematically analyze double descent with ordinary linear regression and identify three interpretable factors that, when simultaneously all present, together create double descent. We demonstrate that double descent occurs on real data when using ordinary linear regression, then demonstrate that double descent does not occur when any of the three factors are ablated. We use this understanding to shed light on recent observations in nonlinear models concerning superposition and double descent. Code is publicly available."}}

What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness, transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent abilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models."}}

The central promises of deep learning-based modeling of brain circuits are that the models shed light on evolutionary optimization problems, constraints and solutions, and generate novel predictions regarding neural phenomena. We show, through the case-study of grid cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, that one often gets neither. We begin by reviewing the principles of grid cell mechanism and function obtained from analytical and first-principles modeling efforts, then consider the claims of deep learning models of grid cells and rigorously examine their results under varied conditions. Using large-scale hyperparameter sweeps and hypothesis-driven experimentation, we demonstrate that the results of such models may reveal more about particular and non-fundamental implementation choices than fundamental truths about neural circuits or the loss function(s) they might optimize. Finally, we discuss why it is that these models of the brain cannot be expected to work without the addition of substantial amounts of inductive bias, an informal No Free Lunch theorem for Neuroscience. In conclusion, caution and consideration, together with biological knowledge, are warranted in building and interpreting deep learning models in Neuroscience."}}

How is this possible? We present an algorithmic theory of metacognition based on a well-understood trade-off in reinforcement learning (RL) between value-based RL and policy-based RL. To the cognitive (neuro)science community, our theory answers the outstanding question of why information can be used for error detection but not for action selection. To the machine learning community, our proposed theory creates a novel interaction between the Actor and Critic in Actor-Critic agents and notes a novel connection between RL and Bayesian Optimization. We call our proposed agent the Metacognitive Actor Critic (MAC). We conclude with showing how to create metacognition in machines by implementing a deep MAC and showing that it can detect (some of) its own suboptimal actions without external information or delay."}}
