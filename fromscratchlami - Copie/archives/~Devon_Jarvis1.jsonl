These models leverage compositional architectures which aim to learn specialized modules dedicated to structures in a task that can be composed to solve novel problems with similar structures. While the compositionality of these architectures is guaranteed by design, the modules specializing is not. Here we theoretically study the ability of network modules to specialize to useful structures in a dataset and achieve systematic generalization. To this end we introduce a minimal space of datasets motivated by practical systematic generalization benchmarks. From this space of datasets we present a mathematical definition of systematicity and study the learning dynamics of linear neural modules when solving components of the task. Our results shed light on the difficulty of module specialization, what is required for modules to successfully specialize, and the necessity of modular architectures to achieve systematicity. Finally, we confirm that the theoretical results in our tractable setting generalize to more complex datasets and non-linear architectures."}}

In particular, we find that in environments where states do not significantly overlap, variational autoencoders (VAEs) fail to learn useful features. We demonstrate this failure in a simple gridworld domain, and then provide a solution in the form of metric learning. However, metric learning requires supervision in the form of a distance function, which is absent in reinforcement learning. To overcome this, we leverage the sequential nature of states in a replay buffer to approximate a distance metric and provide a weak supervision signal, under the assumption that temporally close states are also semantically similar. We modify a VAE with triplet loss and demonstrate that this approach is able to learn useful features for downstream tasks, without additional supervision, in environments where standard VAEs fail."}}

Empirical studies have shown that the learning procedure and network architecture can influence systematicity in deep networks, but the underlying reasons for this influence remain unclear. Here we theoretically study the acquisition of systematic knowledge by simple neural networks. We introduce a minimal space of datasets with systematic and non-systematic features in both the input and output. For shallow and deep linear networks, we derive learning trajectories for all datasets in this space. The solutions reveal that both shallow and deep networks rely on non-systematic inputs to the same extent throughout learning, such that even with early stopping, no networks learn a fully systematic mapping. Turning to the impact of architecture, we show that modularity improves extraction of systematic structure, but only achieves perfect systematicity in the trivial setting where systematic mappings are fully segregated from non-systematic information. Finally, we analyze iterated learning, a procedure in which generations of networks learn from languages generated by earlier learners. Here we find that networks with output modularity successfully converge over generations to a fully systematic `language\u2019 starting from any dataset in our space. Our results contribute to clarifying the role of learning regime, architecture, and dataset structure in promoting systematic generalization, and provide theoretical support for empirical observations that iterated learning can improve systematicity."}}

In this work, however, we aim to show that this is only true for a noiseless system and in general the trend of the model towards wide areas in the landscape reflect the propensity of the model to overfit the training data. Utilizing the objective Bayesian (Jeffreys) prior we instead propose a different determinant of the optimal width within the parameter landscape determined solely by the curvature of the landscape. In doing so we utilize the decomposition of the landscape into the dimensions of principal curvature and find the first principal curvature dimension of the parameter space to be independent of noise within the training data."}}
