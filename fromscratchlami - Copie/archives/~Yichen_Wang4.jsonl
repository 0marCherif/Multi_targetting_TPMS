However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability."}}

Latest proposed detectors usually take coarse text sequence as input and output some good results by fine-tune pretrained models with standard cross-entropy loss. However, these methods fail to consider the linguistic aspect of text (e.g., coherence) and sentence-level structures. Moreover, they lack the ability to handle the low-resource problem which could often happen in practice considering the enormous amount of textual data online. In this paper, we present a coherence-based contrastive learning model named CoCo to detect the possible MGT under low-resource scenario. Inspired by the distinctiveness and permanence properties of linguistic feature, we represent text as a coherence graph to capture its entity consistency, which is further encoded by the pretrained model and graph neural network. To tackle the challenges of data limitations, we employ a contrastive learning framework and propose an improved contrastive loss for making full use of hard negative samples in training stage. The experiment results on two public datasets prove our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods significantly."}}
