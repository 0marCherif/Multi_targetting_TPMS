The proposed rank selection algorithm can effectively determine the proper ranks of the target convolutional layers for the low rank approximation. Our two-pass CP-decomposition helps prevent from the instability problem. The iterative flow makes the decomposition of the deeper networks systematic. The experiment results shows that VGG16 can be accelerated with a 6.2x measured speedup while the accuracy drop remains only 1.2%.\n"}}
