For instance, web search engines recognize queries that seek the value of an entity on a specific attribute (referred to as e+a queries) and provide direct answers for them using a combination of knowledge bases, web tables and documents. However, users often refer to an attribute in their e+a query differently from how it is referred in the web table or text passage. In such cases, search engines may fail to return relevant answers. To address that problem, we propose to automatically discover all the alternate ways of referring to the attributes of a given class of entities (referred to as attribute synonyms) in order to improve search quality. The state-of-the-art approach that relies on attribute name co-occurrence in web tables suffers from low precision. Our main insight is to combine positive evidence of attribute synonymity from query click logs, with negative evidence from web table attribute name co-occurrences. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem on a graph, with the attribute names being the vertices and the positive and negative evidences from query logs and web table schemas as weighted edges. We develop a linear programming based algorithm to solve the problem that has bi-criteria approximation guarantees. Our experiments on real-life datasets show that our approach has significantly higher precision and recall compared with the state-of-the-art."}}

Previous works often take a \"literal\" view of the entity, i.e., its string name. In this work, we propose adopting a \"structured\" view of each entity by considering not only its string name, but also other important structured attributes. Unlike existing query log-based methods, we delve deeper to explore sub-queries, and exploit tailed synonyms and tailed web pages for harvesting more synonyms. A general, heterogeneous graph-based data model which encodes our problem insights is designed by capturing three key concepts (synonym candidate, web page and keyword) and different types of interactions between them. We cast the synonym discovery problem into a graph-based ranking problem and demonstrate the existence of a closed-form optimal solution for outputting entity synonym scores. Experiments on several real-life domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}}

Acronym usage is becoming more common in web searches, email, text messages, tweets, blogs and posts. Acronyms are typically ambiguous and often disambiguated by context words. Given either just an acronym as a query or an acronym with a few context words, it is immensely useful for a search engine to know the most likely intended meanings, ranked by their likelihood. To support such online scenarios, we study the offline mining of acronyms and their meanings in this paper. For each acronym, our goal is to discover all distinct meanings and for each meaning, compute the expanded string, its popularity score and a set of context words that indicate this meaning. Existing approaches are inadequate for this purpose. Our main insight is to leverage \"co-clicks\" in search engine query click log to mine expansions of acronyms. There are several technical challenges such as ensuring 1:1 mapping between expansions and meanings, handling of \"tail meanings\" and extracting context words. We present a novel, end-to-end solution that addresses the above challenges. We further describe how web search engines can leverage the mined information for prediction of intended meaning for queries containing acronyms. Our experiments show that our approach (i) discovers the meanings of acronyms with high precision and recall, (ii) significantly complements existing meanings in Wikipedia and (iii) accurately predicts intended meaning for online queries with over 90% precision."}}

Most of previous visual search systems adopt the framework of \u201dBag of Words\u201d, in which words indicate quantized codes of visual features. In this work, we propose a novel visual search system based on \u201dBag of Hash Bits\u201d (BoHB), in which each local feature is encoded to a very small number of hash bits, instead of quantized to visual words, and the whole image is represented as bag of hash bits. The proposed BoHB method offers unique benefits in solving the challenges associated with mobile visual search, e.g., low transmission cost, cheap memory and computation on the mobile side, etc. Moreover, our BoHB method leverages the distinct properties of hashing bits such as multi-table indexing, multiple bucket probing, bit reuse, and hamming distance based ranking to achieve efficient search over gigantic visual databases. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art mobile visual search methods like CHoG, and other (conventional desktop) visual search approaches like bag of words via vocabulary tree, or product quantization. The proposed BoHB approach is easy to implement on mobile devices, and general in the sense that it can be applied to different types of local features, hashing algorithms and image databases. We also incorporate a boundary feature in the reranking step to describe the object shapes, complementing the local features that are usually used to characterize the local details. The boundary feature can further filter out noisy results and improve the search performance, especially at the coarse category level. Extensive experiments over large-scale data sets up to 400k product images demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

In many cases, these target entities are (i) ad-hoc, i.e., do not exist in a knowledge base and (ii) homogeneous (e.g., all the entities are IT companies). We study the following novel disambiguation problem in this unique setting: given the candidate mentions of all the target entities, determine which ones are true mentions of a target entity. Prior techniques only consider target entities present in a knowledge base and/or having a rich set of attributes. In this paper, we develop novel techniques that require no knowledge about the entities except their names. Our main insight is to leverage the homogeneity constraint and disambiguate the candidate mentions collectively across all documents. We propose a graph-based model, called MentionRank, for that purpose. Furthermore, if additional knowledge is available for some or all of the entities, our model can leverage it to further improve quality. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on targeted entity disambiguation for ad-hoc entities."}}

The current trend is to automatically discover entity synonyms using statistical techniques on web data. Prior techniques suffer from several limitations like click log sparsity and inability to distinguish between entities of different concept classes. In this paper, we propose a general framework for robustly discovering entity synonym with two novel similarity functions that overcome the limitations of prior techniques. We develop efficient and scalable techniques leveraging the MapReduce framework to discover synonyms at large scale. To handle long entity names with extraneous tokens, we propose techniques to effectively map long entity names to short queries in query log. Our experiments on real data from different entity domains demonstrate the superior quality of our synonyms as well as the efficiency of our algorithms. The entity synonyms produced by our system is in production in Bing Shopping and Video search, with experiments showing the significance it brings in improving search experience."}}

Consider a product catalog containing product names and possibly short descriptions. For a product in the catalog, say Ricoh G600 Digital Camera, we want to associate etags such as \"water resistant\", \"rugged\" and \"outdoor\" to it, even though its name or description does not mention those phrases. Entity tagging can enable more effective search over entities. We propose to leverage signals in web documents to perform such tagging. We develop techniques to perform such tagging in a domain independent manner while ensuring high precision and high recall."}}
