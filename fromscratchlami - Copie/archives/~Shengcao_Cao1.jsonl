Knowledge distillation is one effective strategy to improve the performance of lightweight classification models, but it is less well-explored for structured outputs such as object detection and instance segmentation, where the variable number of outputs and complex internal network modules complicate the distillation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective sequential approach to knowledge distillation that progressively transfers the knowledge of a set of teachers to a given lightweight student. Our approach is inspired by curriculum learning: To distill knowledge from a highly accurate but complex teacher model, we construct a sequence of teachers to help the student gradually adapt. Our progressive distillation strategy can be easily combined with existing distillation mechanisms to consistently maximize student performance in various settings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully distill knowledge from Transformer-based teacher detectors to convolution-based students, and unprecedentedly boost the performance of ResNet-50 based RetinaNet from 36.5% to 42.0% AP and Mask R-CNN from 38.2% to 42.5% AP on the MS COCO benchmark."}}

Given fixed computational resources, one can either invest more time training each model to obtain more accurate estimates of final performance, or spend more time exploring a greater variety of models in the configuration space. In this work, we aim to optimize this exploration-exploitation trade-off in the context of HPO and NAS for image classification by accurately approximating a model's maximal performance early in the training process. In contrast to recent accelerated NAS methods customized for certain search spaces, e.g., requiring the search space to be differentiable, our method is flexible and imposes almost no constraints on the search space. Our method uses the evolution history of features of a network during the early stages of training to build a proxy classifier that matches the peak performance of the network under consideration. We show that our method can be combined with multiple search algorithms to find better solutions to a wide range of tasks in HPO and NAS. Using a sampling-based search algorithm and parallel computing, our method can find an architecture which is better than DARTS and with an 80% reduction in wall-clock search time."}}

In this paper, we investigate the causes of the optimization difficulty in the training of DETR. Our examinations reveal several factors contributing to the slow convergence of DETR, primarily the issues with the Hungarian loss and the Transformer cross-attention mechanism. To overcome these issues we propose two solutions, namely, TSP-FCOS (Transformer-based Set Prediction with FCOS) and TSP-RCNN (Transformer-based Set Prediction with RCNN). Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only converge much faster than the original DETR, but also significantly outperform DETR and other baselines in terms of detection accuracy.

Due to the high computational cost of training models until full convergence, it is necessary to develop efficient methods that can accurately estimate a model's best performance using only a small time budget. To this end, we propose a novel performance estimation method which uses a history of model features observed during the early stages of training to obtain an estimate of final performance. Our method is versatile. It can be combined with different search algorithms and applied to various configuration spaces in HPO and NAS.

To achieve better generalization, we propose a novel neighborhood-aware NAS formulation to identify flat-minima architectures in the search space, with the assumption that flat minima generalize better than sharp minima. The phrase ``flat-minima architecture'' refers to architectures whose performance is stable under small perturbations in the architecture (\\emph{e.g.}, replacing a convolution with a skip connection). Our formulation takes the ``flatness'' of an architecture into account by aggregating the performance over the neighborhood of this architecture. We demonstrate a principled way to apply our formulation to existing search algorithms, including sampling-based algorithms and gradient-based algorithms. To facilitate the application to gradient-based algorithms, we also propose a differentiable representation for the neighborhood of architectures. Based on our formulation, we propose neighborhood-aware random search (NA-RS) and neighborhood-aware differentiable architecture search (NA-DARTS). Notably, by simply augmenting DARTS~\\cite{liu2018darts} with our formulation, NA-DARTS finds architectures that perform better or on par with those found by state-of-the-art NAS methods on established benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIAFR-100 and ImageNet."}}

We demonstrate that our search algorithm can significantly outperform various baseline methods, such as random search and reinforcement learning (Ashok et al., 2018). The compressed architectures found by our method are also better than the state-of-the-art manually-designed compact architecture ShuffleNet (Zhang et al., 2018).
