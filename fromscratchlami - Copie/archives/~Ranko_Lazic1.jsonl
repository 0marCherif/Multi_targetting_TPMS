We prove that two-layer ReLU neural networks with random weights can be adversarially reprogrammed to achieve arbitrarily high accuracy on Bernoulli data models over hypercube vertices, provided the network width is no greater than its input dimension.  We also substantially strengthen a recent result of Phuong and Lampert on directional convergence of gradient flow, and obtain as a corollary that training two-layer ReLU neural networks on orthogonally separable datasets can cause their adversarial reprogramming to fail.  We support these theoretical results by experiments that demonstrate that, as long as batch normalisation layers are suitably initialised, even untrained networks with random weights are susceptible to adversarial reprogramming.  This is in contrast to observations in several recent works that suggested that adversarial reprogramming is not possible for untrained networks to any degree of reliability."}}

There exists a fully abstract game model of $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ , which in principle can be used to prove equivalence and safety of $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ programs. Unfortunately, the problems are undecidable for the whole language, and only very rudimentary decidable sub-languages are known. We propose leafy automata as a dedicated automata-theoretic formalism for representing the game semantics of $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ . The automata use an infinite alphabet with a tree structure. We show that the game semantics of any $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ term can be represented by traces of a leafy automaton. Conversely, the traces of any leafy automaton can be represented by a $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ term. Because of the close match with $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ , we view leafy automata as a promising starting point for finding decidable subclasses of the language and, more generally, to provide a new perspective on models of higher-order concurrent computation. Moreover, we identify a fragment of $$\\mathsf {FICA}$$ that is amenable to verification by translation into a particular class of leafy automata. Using a locality property of the latter class, where communication between levels is restricted and every other level is bounded, we show that their emptiness problem is decidable by reduction to Petri net reachability."}}

As a key underlying technical result, we show that, if a configuration is reachable, then there exists a witnessing path whose sequence of transitions is contained in a bounded language defined by a regular expression of pseudo-polynomially bounded length. This, in turn, enables us to prove that the lengths of minimal reachability witnesses are pseudo-polynomially bounded."}}

Our language of choice is Finitary Idealised Concurrent Algol (FICA) due to its relatively simple fully abstract game model.Our first contribution is an automata model over a tree-structured infinite data alphabet, called split automata, whose distinctive feature is the separation of control and memory. We show that every FICA term can be translated into such an automaton. Thanks to the structure of split automata, we are able to observe subtle aspects of the underlying game semantics.This enables us to identify a fragment of FICA with iteration and limited synchronisation (but without recursion), for which, in contrast to the whole FICA, a variety of verification problems turn out to be decidable."}}
