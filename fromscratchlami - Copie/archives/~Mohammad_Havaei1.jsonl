Therefore, the need to uncover the black boxes to rational representational space of these neural networks is apparent. Concept bottleneck model (CBM) encourages interpretability by predicting human-understandable concepts. They predict concepts from input images and then labels from concepts. Test time intervention, a salient feature of CBM, allows for human-model interactions. However, these interactions are prone to information leakage and can often be ineffective inappropriate communication with humans. We propose a novel uncertainty based strategy, \\emph{SIUL: Single Interventional Uncertainty Learning} to select the interventions. Additionally, we empirically test the robustness of CBM and the effect of SIUL interventions under adversarial attack and distributional shift. Using SIUL, we observe that the interventions suggested lead to meaningful corrections along with mitigation of concept leakage. Extensive experiments on three vision datasets along with a histopathology dataset validate the effectiveness of our interventional learning. "}}

Despite impressive predictive performance on a single modality, neural networks cannot reach human level accuracy with respect to multiple modalities. This is a particularly challenging task due to variations in the structure of respective modalities. A popular method, Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN), was proposed to learn contextual features to aid a deep learning task. This uses the auxiliary data to improve representational power by learning affine transformation for Convolution Neural Networks. Despite the boost in performance by using CBN layer, our work reveals that the visual features learned by introducing auxiliary data via CBN deteriorates. We perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the brittleness of a dataset to CBN. We show the sensitivity of CBN to the dataset, suggesting that learning from visual features could often be superior for generalization. We perform exhaustive experiments on natural images for bird classification and histology images for cancer type classification. We observe that the CBN network, learns close to no visual features on the bird classification dataset and partial visual features on the histology dataset. Our experiments reveal that CBN may encourage shortcut learning between the auxiliary data and labels. \n"}}

In this work, we argue that in order to generalize better across non-i.i.d. clients, it is imperative only to learn correlations that are stable and invariant across domains. We propose FL Games, a game-theoretic framework for federated learning that learns causal features that are invariant across clients. While training to achieve the Nash equilibrium, the traditional best response strategy suffers from high-frequency oscillations. We demonstrate that FL Games effectively resolves this challenge and exhibits smooth performance curves. Further, FL Games scales well in the number of clients, requires significantly fewer communication rounds, and is agnostic to device heterogeneity. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that \\flgames achieves high out-of-distribution performance on various benchmarks."}}

Batch normalization applied in convolutional networks consists of a normalization step, followed by the application of per-channel trainable affine parameters which shift and scale the normalized features. The use of these affine parameters can speed up model convergence on a source task. However, we demonstrate in this work that, on common few-shot learning benchmarks, training a model on a source task using these affine parameters is detrimental to downstream transfer performance. We study this effect for several methods on well-known benchmarks such as cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) benchmark and few-shot image classification on miniImageNet. We find consistent performance gains, particularly in settings with more distant transfer tasks. Improvements from applying this low-cost and easy-to-implement modifications are shown to rival gains obtained by more sophisticated and costly methods."}}

Conditional Adversarial Generative Networks (cGANs) use a conditioning factor to generate images and have shown great success in recent years. Intuitively, the information in an image can be divided into two parts: 1) content which is presented through the conditioning vector and 2) style which is the undiscovered information missing from the conditioning vector. Current practices in using cGANs for medical image generation, only use a single variable for image generation (i.e., content) and therefore, do not provide much flexibility nor control over the generated image. In this work we propose a methodology to learn from the image itself, disentangled representations of style and content, and use this information to impose control over the generation process. In this framework, style is learned in a fully unsupervised manner, while content is learned through both supervised learning (using the conditioning vector) and unsupervised learning (with the inference mechanism). We undergo two novel regularization steps to ensure content-style disentanglement. First, we minimize the shared information between content and style by introducing a novel application of the gradient reverse layer (GRL); second, we introduce a self-supervised regularization method to further separate information in the content and style variables. We show that in general, two latent variable models achieve better performance and give more control over the generated image. We also show that our proposed model (DRAI) achieves the best disentanglement score and has the best overall performance."}}

In contrast to the prevalent HTL and UDA approaches that typically use a single hypothesis, HDMI employs multiple hypotheses to leverage the underlying distributions of the source and target hypotheses. To better utilize the crucial relationship among different hypotheses -- as opposed to unconstrained optimization of each hypothesis independently -- while adapting to the unlabeled target domain through mutual information maximization, HDMI incorporates a hypothesis disparity regularization that coordinates the target hypotheses jointly learn better target representations while preserving more transferable source knowledge with better-calibrated prediction uncertainty. HDMI achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance on benchmark datasets for UDA in the context of HTL, without the need to access the source data during the adaptation."}}

Non-stationarity can be caused by either task drift, i.e., the drift in the conditional distribution of labels given the input data, or the domain drift, i.e., the drift in the marginal distribution of the input data. This paper aims to tackle this challenge in the context of continuous domain adaptation, where the model is required to learn new tasks adapted to new domains in a non-stationary environment while maintaining previously learned knowledge. To deal with both drifts, we propose variational domain-agnostic feature replay, an approach that is composed of three components: an inference module that filters the input data into domain-agnostic representations, a generative module that facilitates knowledge transfer, and a solver module that applies the filtered and transferable knowledge to solve the queries. We address the two fundamental scenarios in continuous domain adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach for practical usage."}}

We show in our experiments that FoCL has faster adaptation to distributional changes in sequentially arriving tasks, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance for generative models in task incremental learning. We discuss choices of combined regularization spaces towards different use case scenarios for boosted performance, e.g., tasks that have high variability in the background. Finally, we introduce a forgetfulness measure that fairly evaluates the degree to which a model suffers from forgetting. Interestingly, the analysis of our proposed forgetfulness score also implies that FoCL tends to have a mitigated forgetting for future tasks."}}
