Prior work generally aims to build embodied agents that solve their assigned tasks as quickly as possible, while largely ignoring the problems caused by collision with objects during interaction. This lack of prioritization is understandable: there is no inherent cost in breaking virtual objects. As a result, \"well-trained\" agents frequently collide with objects before achieving their primary goals, a behavior that would be catastrophic in the real world. In this paper, we study the problem of training agents to complete the task of visual mobile manipulation in the ManipulaTHOR environment while avoiding unnecessary collision (disturbance) with objects. We formulate disturbance avoidance as a penalty term in the reward function, but find that directly training with such penalized rewards often results in agents being unable to escape poor local optima. Instead, we propose a two-stage training curriculum where an agent is first allowed to freely explore and build basic competencies without penalization, after which a disturbance penalty is introduced to refine the agent\u2019s behavior. Results on testing scenes show that our curriculum not only avoids these poor local optima, but also leads to 10% absolute gains in success rate without disturbance, compared to our state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, our curriculum is significantly more performant than a safe RL algorithm that casts collision avoidance as a constraint. Finally, we propose a novel disturbance-prediction auxiliary task that accelerates learning. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"}}

While these varied tasks have different end goals, the basic skills required to complete them successfully overlap significantly. In this paper, our goal is to leverage these shared skills to learn to perform multiple tasks jointly. We propose Atomic Skill Completion (ASC), an approach for multi-task training for Embodied AI, where a set of atomic skills shared across multiple tasks are composed together to perform the tasks. The key to the success of this approach is a pre-training scheme that decouples learning of the skills from the high-level tasks making joint training effective. We use ASC to train agents within the AI2-THOR environment to perform four interactive tasks jointly and find it to be remarkably effective. In a multi-task setting, ASC improves success rates by a factor of 2x on Seen scenes and 4x on Unseen scenes compared to no pre-training. Importantly, ASC enables us to train a multi-task agent that has a 52% higher Success Rate than training 4 independent single task agents. Finally, our hierarchical agents are more interpretable than traditional black-box architectures."}}

Large neural models trained on such datasets produce impressive results and top many of today's benchmarks. A notable omission within this family of large-scale datasets is 3D data. Despite considerable interest and potential applications in 3D vision, datasets of high-fidelity 3D models continue to be mid-sized with limited diversity of object categories. Addressing this gap, we present Objaverse 1.0, a large dataset of objects with 800K+ (and growing) 3D models with descriptive captions, tags, and animations. Objaverse improves upon present day 3D repositories in terms of scale, number of categories, and in the visual diversity of instances within a category. We demonstrate the large potential of Objaverse via four diverse applications: training generative 3D models, improving tail category segmentation on the LVIS benchmark, training open-vocabulary object-navigation models for Embodied AI, and creating a new benchmark for robustness analysis of vision models. Objaverse can open new directions for research and enable new applications across the field of AI."}}

We investigate these challenges in the context of Iconary, a collaborative game of drawing and guessing based on Pictionary, that poses a novel challenge for the research community. In Iconary, a Guesser tries to identify a phrase that a Drawer is drawing by composing icons, and the Drawer iteratively revises the drawing to help the Guesser in response. This back-and-forth often uses canonical scenes, visual metaphor, or icon compositions to express challenging words, making it an ideal test for mixing language and visual/symbolic communication in AI. We propose models to play Iconary and train them on over 55,000 games between human players. Our models are skillful players and are able to employ world knowledge in language models to play with words unseen during training. Elite human players outperform our models, particularly at the drawing task, leaving an important gap for future research to address. We release our dataset, code, and evaluation setup as a challenge to the community at github.com/allenai/iconary."}}

However, we show that when the teaching agent makes decisions with access to privileged information that is unavailable to the student, this information is marginalized during imitation learning, resulting in an \"imitation gap\" and, potentially, poor results. Prior work bridges this gap via a progression from imitation learning to reinforcement learning. While often successful, gradual progression fails for tasks that require frequent switches between exploration and memorization. To better address these tasks and alleviate the imitation gap we propose 'Adaptive Insubordination' (ADVISOR). ADVISOR dynamically weights imitation and reward-based reinforcement learning losses during training, enabling on-the-fly switching between imitation and exploration. On a suite of challenging tasks set within gridworlds, multi-agent particle environments, and high-fidelity 3D simulators, we show that on-the-fly switching with ADVISOR outperforms pure imitation, pure reinforcement learning, as well as their sequential and parallel combinations."}}
