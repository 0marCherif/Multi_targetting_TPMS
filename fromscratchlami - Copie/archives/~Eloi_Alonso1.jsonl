To promote the development of more broadly applicable methods, organizers need to enforce the use of general techniques, the use of sample-efficient methods, and the reproducibility of the results. While beneficial for the research community, these restrictions come at a cost -- increased difficulty. If the barrier for entry is too high, many potential participants are demoralized. With this in mind, we hosted the third edition of the MineRL ObtainDiamond competition, MineRL Diamond 2021, with a separate track in which we permitted any solution to promote the participation of newcomers. With this track and more extensive tutorials and support, we saw an increased number of submissions. The participants of this easier track were able to obtain a diamond, and the participants of the harder track progressed the generalizable solutions in the same task."}}

A crucial component of NPCs is navigation, which allows them to move from one point to another on the map. The most popular approach for NPC navigation in the video game industry is to use a navigation mesh (NavMesh), which is a graph representation of the map, with nodes and edges indicating traversable areas. Unfortunately, complex navigation abilities that extend the character's capacity for movement, e.g., grappling hooks, jetpacks, teleportation, or double-jumps, increase the complexity of the NavMesh, making it intractable in many practical scenarios. Game designers are thus constrained to only add abilities that can be handled by a NavMesh. As an alternative to the NavMesh, we propose to use Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) to learn how to navigate 3D maps in video games using any navigation ability. We test our approach on complex 3D environments that are notably an order of magnitude larger than maps typically used in the Deep RL literature. One of these environments is from a recently released AAA video game called Hyper Scape. We find that our approach performs surprisingly well, achieving at least 90% success rate in a variety of scenarios using complex navigation abilities."}}

However, skepticism still surrounds the practicality of RL in modern video game development. In this paper, we demonstrate by example that RL can be a great tool for Artificial Intelligence (AI) design in modern, non-trivial video games. We present our RL system for Ubisoft's Roller Champions, a 3v3 Competitive Multiplayer Sports Game played on an oval-shaped skating arena. Our system is designed to keep up with agile, fast-paced development, taking 1--4 days to train a new model following gameplay changes. The AIs are adapted for various game modes, including a 2v2 mode, a Training with Bots mode, in addition to the Classic game mode where they replace players who have disconnected. We observe that the AIs develop sophisticated co-ordinated strategies, and can aid in balancing the game as an added bonus.

Operating under such constraints, we propose Hybrid SAC, an extension of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm able to handle discrete, continuous and parameterized actions in a principled way. We show that Hybrid SAC can successfully solve a highspeed driving task in one of our games, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art on parameterized actions benchmark tasks. We also explore the impact of using normalizing flows to enrich the expressiveness of the policy at minimal computational cost, and identify a potential undesired effect of SAC when used with normalizing flows, that may be addressed by optimizing a different objective."}}

We use bidirectional LSTM recurrent layers to get an embedding of the word to be rendered, and we feed it to the generator network. We also modify the standard GAN by adding an auxiliary network for text recognition. The system is then trained with a balanced combination of an adversarial loss and a CTC loss. Together, these extensions to GAN enable to control the textual content of the generated word images yielding realistic-looking images on both French and Arabic languages. State-of-the-art offline handwriting text recognition systems tend to use neural networks and therefore require a large amount of annotated data to be trained. In order to partially satisfy this requirement, we could use those synthetic images to increase the amount of training data. We show that integrating generated images into the existing training data of a text recognition system can slightly enhance its performance."}}
