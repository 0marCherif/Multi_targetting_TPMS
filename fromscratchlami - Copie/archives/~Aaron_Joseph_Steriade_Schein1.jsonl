These latent states manifest through countries' cooperative versus conflictual interactions over time. State-space models (SSMs) explicitly relate the dynamics of observed measurements to transitions in latent states. For discrete data, SSMs commonly do so through a state-to-action emission matrix and a state-to-state transition matrix. This paper introduces the Ordered Matrix Dirichlet (OMD) as a prior distribution over ordered stochastic matrices wherein the discrete distribution in the kth row stochastically dominates the (k+1)th, such that probability mass is shifted to the right when moving down rows. We illustrate the OMD prior within two SSMs: a hidden Markov model, and a novel dynamic Poisson Tucker decomposition model tailored to international relations data. We find that models built on the OMD recover interpretable ordered latent structure without forfeiting predictive performance. We suggest future applications to other domains where models with stochastic matrices are popular (e.g., topic modeling), and publish user-friendly code."}}

Advances in automated event extraction have yielded massive data sets of \"who did what to whom\" micro-records that enable data-driven approaches to monitoring conflict. The Goldstein scale is a widely-used expert-based measure that scores events on a conflictual-cooperative scale. It is based only on the action category (\"what\") and disregards the subject (\"who\") and object (\"to whom\") of an event, as well as contextual information, like associated casualty count, that should contribute to the perception of an event's \"intensity\". This paper takes a latent variable-based approach to measuring conflict intensity. We introduce a probabilistic generative model that assumes each observed event is associated with a latent intensity class. A novel aspect of this model is that it imposes an ordering on the classes, such that higher-valued classes denote higher levels of intensity. The ordinal nature of the latent variable is induced from naturally ordered aspects of the data (e.g., casualty counts) where higher values naturally indicate higher intensity. We evaluate the proposed model both intrinsically and extrinsically, showing that it obtains comparatively good held-out predictive performance."}}

Yet, within a single tumor there is often extensive genetic heterogeneity as evidenced by single-cell and bulk DNA sequencing data. The goal of this work is to jointly infer the underlying genotypes of tumor subpopulations and the distribution of those subpopulations in individual tumors by integrating single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Understanding the genetic composition of the tumor at the time of treatment is important in the personalized design of targeted therapeutic combinations and monitoring for possible recurrence after treatment. We propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model that incorporates the correlation structure induced by a structured sampling arrangement and we show that this model improves the quality of inference. We develop a representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior as a Gamma-Poisson hierarchy and we use this representation to derive a fast Gibbs sampling inference algorithm using the augment-and marginalize method. Experiments with simulation data show that our model outperforms standard numerical and statistical methods for decomposing admixed count data. Analyses of real acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer sequencing dataset shows that our model improves upon state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. An interpretation of the results of our model on this real dataset reveals co-mutated loci across samples."}}

Prior to the most recent US midterm elections in 2018, the mobile app Outvote randomized an aspect of their system, hoping to unobtrusively assess the causal effect of their users\u2019 messages on voter turnout. However, properly assessing this causal effect is hindered by multiple statistical challenges, including attenuation bias due to mismeasurement of subjects\u2019 outcomes and low precision due to two-sided non-compliance with subjects\u2019 assignments. We address these challenges, which are likely to impinge upon any study that seeks to randomize authentic friend-to-friend interactions, by tailoring the statistical analysis to make use of additional data about both users and subjects. Using meta-data of users\u2019 in-app behavior, we reconstruct subjects\u2019 positions in users\u2019 queues. We use this information to refine the study population to more compliant subjects who were higher in the queues, and we do so in a systematic way which optimizes a proxy for the study\u2019s power. To mitigate attenuation bias, we then use ancillary data of subjects\u2019 matches to the voter rolls that lets us refine the study population to one with low rates of outcome mismeasurement. Our analysis reveals statistically significant treatment effects from friend-to-friend mobilization efforts ( 8.3, CI = (1.2, 15.3)) that are among the largest reported in the get-out-the-vote (GOTV) literature. While social pressure from friends has long been conjectured to play a role in effective GOTV treatments, the present study is among the first to assess these effects experimentally."}}
