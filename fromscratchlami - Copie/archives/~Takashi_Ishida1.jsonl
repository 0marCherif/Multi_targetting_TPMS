A Direct Approach to Estimating the Bayes Error in Binary Classification", "abstract": "There is a fundamental limitation in the prediction performance that a machine learning model can achieve due to the inevitable uncertainty of the prediction target. In classification problems, this can be characterized by the Bayes error, which is the best achievable error with any classifier. The Bayes error can be used as a criterion to evaluate classifiers with state-of-the-art performance and can be used to detect test set overfitting. We propose a simple and direct Bayes error estimator, where we just take the mean of the labels that show \\emph{uncertainty} of the class assignments. Our flexible approach enables us to perform Bayes error estimation even for weakly supervised data. In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free. Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the Bayes error than several baselines empirically. Experiments using our method suggest that recently proposed deep networks such as the Vision Transformer may have reached, or is about to reach, the Bayes error for benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss how we can study the inherent difficulty of the acceptance/rejection decision for scientific articles, by estimating the Bayes error of the ICLR papers from 2017 to 2023."}}

We propose a new approach for the regularization of neural networks by the local Rademacher complexity called LocalDrop. A new regularization function for both fully-connected networks (FCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including drop rates and weight matrices, has been developed based on the proposed upper bound of the local Rademacher complexity by the strict mathematical deduction. The analyses of dropout in FCNs and DropBlock in CNNs with keep rate matrices in different layers are also included in the complexity analyses. With the new regularization function, we establish a two-stage procedure to obtain the optimal keep rate matrix and weight matrix to realize the whole training model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of LocalDrop in different models by comparing it with several algorithms and the effects of different hyperparameters on the final performances."}}

Our approach makes the loss float around the flood level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flood level.

With flooding, the model will continue to \u201crandom walk\u201d with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization.
