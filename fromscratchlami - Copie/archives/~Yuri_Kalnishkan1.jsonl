Under the prediction of packs protocol, the learner must make a few predictions without seeing the respective outcomes and then the outcomes are revealed in one go. The paper develops the theory of prediction with expert advice for packs by generalising the concept of mixability. We propose a number of merging algorithms for prediction of packs with tight worst case loss upper bounds similar to those for Vovk\u2019s Aggregating Algorithm. Unlike existing algorithms for delayed feedback settings, our algorithms do not depend on the order of outcomes in a pack. Empirical experiments on sports and house price datasets are carried out to study the performance of the new algorithms and compare them against an existing method."}}

We propose a universal algorithm predicting finite-dimensional distributions, i.e. points from a simplex, under Kullback\u2013Leibler game. In the standard framework for prediction with expert advice, the performance of the learner is measured by means of the cumulative loss. In this paper we consider a generalisation of this setting and discount losses with time. A natural choice of predictors for the probability games is a class of multinomial logistic regression functions as they output a distribution that lies inside a probability simplex. We consider the class of multinomial logistic regressions to be our experts. We provide a strategy that allows us to \u2018track the best expert\u2019 of this type and derive the theoretical bound on the discounted loss of the strategy. We provide the kernelized version of our algorithm, which competes with a wider set of experts from Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and prove a theoretical guarantee for the kernelized strategy. We carry out experiments on three data sets and compare the cumulative losses of our algorithm and multinomial logistic regression."}}

The behaviour is described as a collection of prolonged events, which are characterised by start/open and end/close times in addition to other useful attributes. We propose the definition of an equilibrium resolution and carry out its analysis based on probabilistic assumptions. The resulting methods of determining the equilibrium resolution are tested on real-life time series data sets from the Financial and Travel problem domains."}}

We show that in some cases the combination of different methods can produce better results compared to a single model. Our approach is based on Weak Aggregating Algorithm (WAA), which is similar to the Bayesian method, where the prediction is the average over all models based on the likelihood of the available data. WAA provides a theoretical guarantee that the prediction strategy is asymptotically as good as the best expert. We propose two ways of combining predictions of different experts. The first approach combines predictions of normal distribution experts, whereas the second method combines predictions of conventional models that are used to estimate Value at Risk. The experimental results on three stocks show that WAA performs close to or better than the best expert model. In addition, backtesting with Kupiec unconditional coverage test and Christoffersen conditional coverage test shows that WAA is the only method that fails to reject the null hypothesis for all test cases."}}
