We propose a transferable Transformer-based image compression framework, termed TransTIC. Inspired by visual prompt tuning, TransTIC adopts an instance-specific prompt generator to inject instance-specific prompts to the encoder and task-specific prompts to the decoder. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is capable of transferring the base codec to various machine tasks and outperforms the competing methods significantly. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to utilize prompting on the low-level image compression task."}}

It is capable of achieving variable-rate compression with a single model while supporting the region-of-interest (ROI) functionality. Inspired by prompt tuning, we introduce prompt generation networks to condition the transformer-based autoencoder of compression. Our prompt generation networks generate content-adaptive tokens according to the input image, an ROI mask, and a rate parameter. The separation of the ROI mask and the rate parameter allows an intuitive way to achieve variable-rate and ROI coding simultaneously. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and confirm its superiority over the other competing methods."}}
