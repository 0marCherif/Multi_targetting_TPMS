In fact, many data-driven applications on the Web (e.g., news-reading and e-shopping) require accurate recognition of much less coarse concepts as entities and proper linking them to a knowledge graph (KG), which can take their performance to the next level. In light of this, in this paper, we identify a new research task: visual entity linking for fine-grained scene understanding. To accomplish the task, we first extract features of candidate entities from different modalities, i.e., visual features, textual features, and KG features. Then, we design a deep modal-attention neural network-based learning-to-rank method which aggregates all features and maps visual objects to the entities in KG. Extensive experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that our proposed method is effective as it significantly improves the accuracy performance from 66.46% to 83.16% compared with baselines."}}

Currently, the recommendation is manually conducted by doctors. However, for complicated cases, like patients with multiple diseases at the same time, it's difficult to propose a considerate recommendation even for experienced doctors. This urges the emergence of automatic medication recommendation which can help treat the diagnosed diseases without causing harmful drug-drug interactions.Due to the clinical value, medication recommendation has attracted growing research interests.Existing works mainly formulate medication recommendation as a multi-label classification task to predict the set of medicines. In this paper, we propose the Conditional Generation Net (COGNet) which introduces a novel copy-or-predict mechanism to generate the set of medicines. Given a patient, the proposed model first retrieves his or her historical diagnoses and medication recommendations and mines their relationship with current diagnoses. Then in predicting each medicine, the proposed model decides whether to copy a medicine from previous recommendations or to predict a new one. This process is quite similar to the decision process of human doctors. We validate the proposed model on the public MIMIC data set, and the experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches."}}

NTM-DMIE is a neural network method for topic learning which maximizes the mutual information between the input documents and their latent topic representation. To learn robust topic representation, we incorporate the discriminator to discriminate negative examples and positive examples via adversarial learning. Moreover, we use both global and local mutual information to preserve the rich information of the input documents in the topic representation. We evaluate NTM-DMIE on several metrics, including accuracy of text clustering, with topic representation, topic uniqueness and topic coherence. Compared to the existing methods, the experimental results show that NTM-DMIE can outperform in all the metrics on the four datasets."}}

Abstract As the core building blocks of the Semantic Web, ontologies provide shared vocabularies and conceptual knowledge for specific application fields. At the same time, ontologies can restrict their individuals and relationships through their semantic schema. However, logical conflicts of an ontology are often inevitably unavoidable in actual application scenarios when the ontology contains any form of disjointness or negation. Generally, logical conflicts can be divided into incoherence and inconsistency. Reasoning with incoherent ontologies may obtain many redundant relationships, and incoherence is a potential cause of inconsistency which seriously affects the correctness of semantic reasoning Therefore, handling incoherence is imperative, which mainly involves the fields of conflicts detection, ontology repair and justification computation. Various incoherent ontologies are indispensable to evaluate the proposed methods for handling incoherence. We provide a survey of relevant research works to study the proposed construction methods of incoherent ontologies. It is observed that incoherent ontologies in existing works still have the following limitations: (1) Lots of web pages used to download ontologies were temporarily constructed are now inaccessible; (2) Most of the existing incoherent ontologies were constructed in a simple way such as randomly adding disjointness axioms or merging ontologies through their alignments without considering all possible incoherence cases. To address the limitations, we propose a general framework to construct incoherent ontologies and design a hybrid algorithm to instantiate this framework. With the implemented construction methods, a comprehensive benchmark containing 116 ontologies is constructed. In our evaluations, incoherent ontologies in the benchmark are measured with 11 classic metrics. We then compare 5 representative ontology debugging systems and 3 repair methods. The evaluation results reveal that these ontologies could reflect different characteristics of each ontology system and repair method. All observations could guide researchers to select incoherent ontologies. The availability of our benchmark makes a contribution to the community of ontology debugging and repair fields."}}

In this paper, we thoroughly compare the continual learning performance over the combination of 5 PLMs and 4 CL approaches on 3 benchmarks in 2 typical incremental settings. Our extensive experimental analyses reveal interesting performance differences across PLMs and across CL methods. Furthermore, our representativeness probing analyses dissect PLMs\u2019 performance characteristics in a layer-wise and task-wise manner, uncovering the extent to which their inner layers suffer from forgetting, and the effect of different CL approaches on each layer.

Given the sequential arrival order of the relations, this task is prone to two serious challenges, namely catastrophic forgetting and order-sensitivity. We propose a novel curriculum-meta learning method to tackle the above two challenges in continual relation extraction. We combine meta learning and curriculum learning to quickly adapt model parameters to a new task and to reduce interference of previously seen tasks on the current task. We design a novel relation representation learning method through the distribution of domain and range types of relations. Such representations are utilized to quantify the difficulty of tasks for the construction of curricula. Moreover, we also present novel difficulty-based metrics to quantitatively measure the extent of order-sensitivity of a given model, suggesting new ways to evaluate model robustness. Our comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.

Training data generated by distant supervision may contain many mislabeled instances, which is harmful to the training of the classifier. Some recent methods show that relevant background information in KBs, such as entity type (e.g., Organization and Book), can improve the performance of DSRE. However, there are three main problems with these methods. Firstly, these methods are tailored for a specific type of information. A specific type of information only has a positive effect on a part of instances and will not be beneficial to all cases. Secondly, different background information is embedded independently, and no reasonable interaction is achieved. Thirdly, previous methods do not consider the side effect of the introduced noise of background information. To address these issues, we leverage five types of background information instead of a specific type of information in previous works and propose a novel edge-reasoning hybrid graph (ER-HG) model to realize reasonable interaction between different kinds of information. In addition, we further employ an attention mechanism for the ER-HG model to alleviate the side effect of noise. The ER-HG model integrates all types of information efficiently and is very robust to the noise of information. We conduct experiments on two widely used datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in held-out metric and robustness tests."}}

However, their performance on single fraud case detection has never reached to a high level, and they cannot detect gang frauds. One of the main causes is that such machine learning models directly neglect the associations between auto insurance cases. To resolve this problem, we propose to leverage knowledge graph techniques to discover associations between cases for fraud detection. We first construct an auto insurance knowledge graph (AIKG) with ontology building and knowledge extraction from relational database. We then apply AIKG to both gang fraud detection and single fraud case detection. We finally conduct comprehensive experiments on fraud detection, and our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics. Our built auto insurance ontology which is the core part of AIKG has been published on the Web and can be open access."}}

Defect prediction faces two major challenges, label scarcity, where only a small percentage of code artifacts are labeled, and data imbalance, where the majority of labeled artifacts are non-defective. Moreover, current defect prediction methods ignore the impact of information propagation among code artifacts and this negligence leads to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose DPCAG, a novel model to address the above three issues. We treat code artifacts as nodes in a graph, and learn to propagate influence among neighboring nodes iteratively in an EM framework. DPCAG dynamically adjusts the contributions of each node and selects high-confidence nodes for data augmentation. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets show that DPCAG improves performance compare to the state-of-the-art models. In particular, DPCAG achieves substantial performance superiority when measured by Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), a metric that is widely acknowledged to be the most suitable for imbalanced data."}}

In this paper, we propose a new formal query building approach that consists of two stages. In the first stage, we predict the query structure of the question and leverage the structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries. We propose a novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and design an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined operation in each generative step. In the second stage, we follow the previous methods to rank the candidate queries. The experimental results show that our formal query building approach outperforms existing methods on complex questions while staying competitive on simple questions."}}
