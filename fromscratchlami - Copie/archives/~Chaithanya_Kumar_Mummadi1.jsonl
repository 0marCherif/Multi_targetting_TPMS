While conventional OSR approaches can detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples, they cannot provide explanations indicating which underlying visual attribute(s) (e.g., shape, color or background) cause a specific sample to be unknown. In this work, we introduce a novel problem setup that generalizes conventional OSR to a multi-attribute setting, where multiple visual attributes are simultaneously recognized. Here, OOD samples can be not only identified but also categorized by their unknown attribute(s). We propose simple extensions of common OSR baselines to handle this novel scenario. We show that these baselines are vulnerable to shortcuts when spurious correlations exist in the training dataset. This leads to poor OOD performance which, according to our experiments, is mainly due to unintended cross-attribute correlations of the predicted confidence scores. We provide an empirical evidence showing that this behavior is consistent across different baselines on both synthetic and real world datasets."}}

We provide a theoretical understanding of this vulnerability and relate it to an adversary's ability to misdirect the attention of all queries to a single key token under the control of the adversarial patch. We propose novel adversarial objectives for crafting adversarial patches which target this vulnerability explicitly. We show the effectiveness of the proposed patch attacks on popular image classification (ViTs and DeiTs) and object detection models (DETR).

Our approach extends the training set with an additional dataset (the source domain), which is specifically designed to facilitate learning independent representations of basic visual factors. We benchmark our idea on synthetic target domains where we explicitly control shortcut opportunities as well as real-world target domains. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of different specifications of the source domain and the network architecture on compositional generalization. Our main finding is that leveraging data from a source domain is an effective way to mitigate shortcut learning.

Specifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by addressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.

This is known as shortcut learning and leads to impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer from shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of variation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides shortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent part of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between predicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to exploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce the Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and metrics to study a network's shortcut vulnerability and generalization capability for six independent FoV. In particular, DiagViB-6 allows controlling the type and degree of SO and GO in a dataset. We benchmark a wide range of popular vision architectures and show that they can exploit GO only to a limited extent."}}
