Various versions of the LM method have been proposed, their main differences being in the choice of a damping parameter. In this paper, we propose a new rule for updating the parameter so as to achieve both global and local convergence even under the presence of a convex constraint set. The key to our results is a new perspective of the LM method from majorization-minimization methods. Specifically, we show that if the damping parameter is set in a specific way, the objective function of the standard subproblem in LM methods becomes an upper bound on the original objective function under certain standard assumptions. Our method solves a sequence of the subproblems approximately using an (accelerated) projected gradient method. It finds an $$\\varepsilon$$ \u03b5 -stationary point after $$O(\\varepsilon ^{-2})$$ O ( \u03b5 - 2 ) computation and achieves local quadratic convergence for zero-residual problems under a local error bound condition. Numerical results on compressed sensing and matrix factorization show that our method converges faster in many cases than existing methods."}}

Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations is one of the essential operations in CGM. Because the MAP inference problem is known to be NP-hard in general, the current mainstream approach is to solve an alternative problem obtained by approximating the objective function and applying continuous relaxation. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count data are negligible due to the inaccuracy of Stirling\u2019s approximation. Second, the application of continuous relaxation causes the violation of integrality constraints. This paper proposes novel algorithms for MAP inference in CGMs on path graphs to overcome these problems. Our method is based on the discrete difference of convex algorithm (DCA); DCA is a general framework to minimize the sum of a convex function and a concave function by repeatedly minimizing surrogate functions. Utilizing the particular structure of path graphs, we efficiently solve the surrogate function minimization by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Furthermore, our approach also leads to a new method of solving another important task; MAP inference of the sample size in CGM on path graphs. Our method is naturally applicable to this task, allowing us to design very efficient algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."}}

In most online matching problems, the rewards and node arrival probabilities are given in advance and are not controllable. However, many real-world matching services require them to be controllable and the decision-maker faces a non-trivial problem of optimizing them. In this study, we formulate a new optimization problem, Online Matching with Controllable Rewards and Arrival probabilities (OM-CRA), to simultaneously determine not only the matching strategy but also the rewards and arrival probabilities. Even though our problem is more complex than the existing ones, we propose a fast 1/2-approximation algorithm for OM-CRA. The proposed approach transforms OM-CRA to a saddle-point problem by approximating the objective function, and then solves it by the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method with acceleration through the use of the problem structure. In simulations on real data from crowdsourcing and ride-sharing platforms, we show that the proposed algorithm can find solutions with high total rewards in practical times."}}

Our proposed model has latent variables called route populations, which represent the pedestrian population who starts each route at each time period, and assumes that pedestrians stochastically walk through roads along the route. The pedestrian depends on the road\u2019s congestion. The proposed model incorporates this dependence in a probabilistic framework, where the time length to pass a road is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution that depends on road congestion. With the reproducing property of Gaussian distribution, we analytically derive the transition probability between roads on each route. The parameters of the proposed method, including the dependence between congestion and speed, congestion for each road, and the latent variables on the route population, are estimated from the given data by minimizing the error between the observed and estimated road populations based on gradient-based optimization methods. In experiments with simulated and real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the proposed model can estimate road populations more accurately than existing methods. We also confirm that it effectively estimates route populations, and the estimated route populations are useful for reproducing real-world population dynamics when used as inputs of a crowd simulator based on a multi-agent system."}}

Collective Graphical Model (CGM) is a probabilistic approach to the analysis of aggregated data. One of the most important operations in CGM is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations. Because the MAP inference problem for general CGMs has been shown to be NP-hard, an approach that solves an approximate problem has been proposed. However, this approach has two major drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count tables are small, because the approximation becomes inaccurate. Second, since continuous relaxation is applied, the integrality constraints of the output are violated. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a new method for MAP inference for CGMs on path graphs. Our method is based on the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA), which is a general methodology to minimize a function represented as the sum of a convex function and a concave function. In our algorithm, important subroutines in DCA can be efficiently calculated by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed method outputs higher quality solutions than the conventional approach. "}}

Even with such applications, aggregated data would be available, such as the number of purchasers for each item and the number of patients with each disease. We propose a method for estimating the co-occurrence of items from aggregated data with auxiliary information. For auxiliary information, we use item features that describe the characteristics of each item. Although many methods have been proposed for estimating the co-occurrence given aggregated data, no existing method can use auxiliary information. We also use records of a small number of users. With our proposed method, we introduce latent co-occurrence variables that represent the amount of co-occurrence for each pair of items. We model a probabilistic generative process of the latent co-occurrence variables by a multinomial distribution with Dirichlet priors. The parameters of the Dirichlet priors are parameterized with neural networks that take the auxiliary information as input, where neural networks are shared across different item pairs. The shared neural networks enable us to learn unknown relationships between auxiliary information and co-occurrence using the data of multiple items. The latent co-occurrence variables and the neural network parameters are estimated by maximizing the sum of the likelihood of the latent co-occurrence variables and the likelihood of the small records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using user-item rating datasets."}}

For dimensionality reduction, it computes a nearest neighbor graph from a given dataset where edge weights are obtained by applying the Lagrange multiplier method, and it then computes eigenvectors of the LLE kernel where the edge weights are used to obtain the kernel. Although LLE is used in many applications, its computation cost is significantly high. This is because, in obtaining edge weights, its computation cost is cubic in the number of edges to each data point. In addition, the computation cost in obtaining the eigenvectors of the LLE kernel is cubic in the number of data points. Our approach, Ripple, is based on two ideas: (1) it incrementally updates the edge weights by exploiting the Woodbury formula and (2) it efficiently computes eigenvectors of the LLE kernel by exploiting the LU decomposition-based inverse power method. Experiments show that Ripple is significantly faster than the original approach of LLE by guaranteeing the same results of dimensionality reduction."}}

In order to reduce the computation cost, it efficiently identifies blocks in the estimated matrix that have nonzero elements before entering the iterations by exploiting the singular value decomposition of data matrix. In addition, it selectively updates elements of the estimated matrix expected to have nonzero values. Theoretically, it guarantees to converge to the same result as the original algorithm of the graphical lasso. Experiments show that our approach is faster than existing approaches."}}
