A Survey and Framework on Event Detection Techniques on Twitter", "abstract": "In the last few years, Twitter has become a popular platform for sharing opinions, experiences, news, and views in real-time. Twitter presents an interesting opportunity for detecting events happening around the world. The content (tweets) published on Twitter are short and pose diverse challenges for detecting and interpreting event-related information. This article provides insights into ongoing research and helps in understanding recent research trends and techniques used for event detection using Twitter data. We classify techniques and methodologies according to event types, orientation of content, event detection tasks, their evaluation, and common practices. We highlight the limitations of existing techniques and accordingly propose solutions to address the shortcomings. We propose a framework called EDoT based on the research trends, common practices, and techniques used for detecting events on Twitter. EDoT can serve as a guideline for developing event detection methods, especially for researchers who are new in this area. We also describe and compare data collection techniques, the effectiveness and shortcomings of various Twitter and non-Twitter-based features, and discuss various evaluation measures and benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we discuss the trends, limitations, and future directions for detecting events on Twitter."}}

Dendrograms represent clusters in a nested manner, where at each step an entity makes a new cluster or merges into an existing cluster. Hierarchical clustering has many applications, therefore researchers have made efforts to come up with improved hierarchical clustering approaches. An approach that has received attention is based on combining clustering results, since different hierarchical clustering algorithms produce different dendrograms and their combination has produced more promising results as compared to individual hierarchical clustering. This paper proposes the hierarchical clustering combination (HCC) approach which uses the different types of structural features present in the dendrogram. Firstly, the dendrograms are represented in a 4+N (4 is the extracted number of features and can be extended to N number) dimensional euclidean space (4+NDES) which results in vector matrices. 4+NDES is the structural representation of the dendrogram which contains not only the relative features but also the absolute features of the entities in the dendrogram. Then the vector matrices are aggregated and the distance is calculated between each two vector using the Euclidean distance measure. The final hierarchy is obtained using a recovery tool like individual hierarchical clustering. 4+NDES-HCC utilizes the structural contents of the dendrogram and has the flexibility to handle an increasing number of features. The proposed approach is tested for software clustering which plays an important role in maintenance of software systems. The experimental results of the proposed approach and comparative analysis with existing approaches reveal the effectiveness of the HCC for software clustering."}}

Proper clone analysis is required to exploit the benefits of clones. A study of software clone evolution serves the purpose of understanding the maintenance implications of clones, which leads to their appropriate management. Structural clones (recurring patterns of simple clones) represent design level similarities in software. Evolutionary characteristics of clones can assess the relevance of those clones for software developers and maintainers. Although the evolution of simple clones has been thoroughly studied by researchers, the evolution of structural clones is still to be explored. In this paper, we study the evolution of structural clones by performing a longitudinal study on multiple versions of five Java systems. To perform a systematic study of the structural clone evolution, we define structural clones and their evolution patterns in a formal notation. Our results show that structural clones are more likely to change inconsistently, however, less frequently than simple clones, whereas the lifetime of the structural clones is similar to that of the simple clones. Evolutionary characteristics of structural clones suggest that they require more attention in their management. Analysis of structural clone evolution reveals similar reasons for changes, and similar trends in evolution patterns, for all subject systems. These trends reveal evolutionary characteristics of structural clones that can help in devising appropriate strategies for managing them, hence devising better clone management systems."}}

Abstract With increasing popularity of social media, Twitter has become one of the leading platforms to report events in real-time. Detecting events from Twitter stream requires complex techniques. Event-related trending topics consist of a group of words which successfully detect and identify events. Event detection techniques must be scalable and robust, so that they can deal with the huge volume and noise associated with social media. Existing event detection methods mostly rely on burstiness, mainly the frequency of words and their co-occurrences. However, burstiness sometimes dominates other relevant details in the data which could be equally significant. Besides, the topological and temporal relationships in the data are often ignored. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach, called the Enhanced Heartbeat Graph (EHG), which detects events efficiently. EHG suppresses dominating topics in the subsequent data stream, after their first detection. Experimental results on three real-world datasets (i.e., Football Association Challenge Cup Final, Super Tuesday, and the US Election 2012) show superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques.

Elevating the analysis of cloning to structural clone level helps in better clone management in terms of clone understanding, maintenance and evolution. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to study structural clone evolution in software versions. We use our approach to analyze the evolutionary behavior of structural clones and also compare it with the evolution of simple clones. We performed experiments on different versions of three Java systems. Our analysis of structural clone evolution reveals interesting evolutionary characteristics of clones. For example, one finding is that simple clones are more frequently changed than structural clones whereas average lifetime of structural clones is less than that of simple clones. Study of clone evolution is helpful for identifying maintenance implications of clones and for devising better clone management systems."}}

Abstract A community structure is an integral part of a social network. Detecting such communities plays an important role in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to cluster analysis, recommendation systems and understanding the behaviour of complex systems. Researchers have derived many algorithms to discover the community structures of networks. Discovering communities is a challenging task, and there is no single algorithm that produces the best results for all networks. Therefore, despite many elegant solutions, discovering communities remains an active area of research. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, the Clustering Coefficient-based Genetic Algorithm (CC-GA), for detecting them in social and complex networks. Researchers have used several genetic algorithms to detect communities, but the proposed algorithm is novel in terms of both the generation of the initial population and the mutation method, and these improve its efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on a variety of real-world datasets and a comparison to state-of-the-art genetic and non-genetic-based algorithms show improved results."}}

Abstract Social media has an impact on many aspects of human life ranging from sharing personal information to revolutionizing political systems of entire countries. One not so well studied aspect of social media is analyzing its usage and efficacy in healthcare, particularly in developing countries which lack state-of-the-art healthcare systems and processes. In such countries, social media may be used to facilitate patient-centric healthcare by involving the patient for fulfilling personal healthcare needs. This article provides an in-depth analysis of one such need, that is, how people use social media to request for blood donations. We study the request and dissemination behavior of people using social media to fulfill blood donation requests. We focus on twitter, and blood donation accounts in India. Our study reveals that each of the seven twitter accounts we studied have a large followership of more than 35,000 users on an average and receive a substantial number (more than 900) of donation requests in a day on an average. We analyze the requests in various ways to present an outlook for healthcare providers to make their systems more patient-centric through a better understanding of the needs of people requesting for blood donations. Our study also identifies areas where future social media enabled automated healthcare systems can focus on the needs of individual patients. These systems can provide support for saving more lives by reducing the gap between blood donors and the people in need. Previous article in issue Next article in issue"}}
