Among the different attacks on AD perception, the physical object-hiding adversarial attacks are especially severe due to their direct impact on road safety.\nHowever, we find that all existing works so far only evaluate their attack effect at the targeted AI component level, without any evaluation \\textit{at the system level}, i.e., with the entire system semantics and context such as the full AD system pipeline and closed-loop control. This thus inevitably raise a critical research question: can these existing research efforts actually effectively achieve the desired system-level attack effects (e.g., causing vehicle collisions, traffic rule violations, etc.) in the real-world AD system context?\n\nIn the paper, we thus perform the first measurement study on whether and how effective the existing designs can lead to system-level effects, where we take the STOP sign-hiding attack as our target. Our evaluation results show that all the representative prior works cannot achieve any system-level effect in a classical closed-loop AD setup in road speeds controlled by common STOP signs. With that, we then point out two limitation hypotheses that appear in all existing works: 1) the unpractical STOP sign size distribution in pixel sampling, and 2) missing particular consideration in system-critical attack range. Experimental results demonstrate that after overcoming these two limitations, the system-level effects can be further improved, i.e., the violation rate can increase around 70\\%."}}

However, existing works cannot handle the general form of cutting plane constraints widely accepted in traditional solvers, which are crucial for strengthening verifiers with tightened convex relaxations. In this paper, we generalize the bound propagation procedure to allow the addition of arbitrary cutting plane constraints, including those involving relaxed integer variables that do not appear in existing bound propagation formulations. Our generalized bound propagation method, GCP-CROWN, opens up the opportunity to apply general cutting plane methods for neural network verification while benefiting from the efficiency and GPU acceleration of bound propagation methods. As a case study, we investigate the use of cutting planes generated by off-the-shelf mixed integer programming (MIP) solver. We find that MIP solvers can generate high-quality cutting planes for strengthening bound-propagation-based verifiers using our new formulation. Since the branching-focused bound propagation procedure and the cutting-plane-focused MIP solver can run in parallel utilizing different types of hardware (GPUs and CPUs), their combination can quickly explore a large number of branches with strong cutting planes, leading to strong verification performance. Experiments demonstrate that our method is the first verifier that can completely solve the oval20 benchmark and verify twice as many instances on the oval21 benchmark compared to the best tool in VNN-COMP 2021, and also noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks. GCP-CROWN is part of the $\\alpha,\\beta$-CROWN verifier, the VNN-COMP 2022 winner. Code is available at http://PaperCode.cc/GCP-CROWN."}}

How to build a robust SNN becomes an urgent issue.\nRecently, many studies apply certified training in artificial neural networks (ANNs), which can improve the robustness of an NN model promisely. However, existing certifications cannot transfer to SNNs directly because of the distinct neuron behavior and input formats for SNNs. In this work, we first design S-IBP and S-CROWN that tackle the non-linear functions in SNNs' neuron modeling. Then, we formalize the boundaries for both digital and spike inputs. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed robust training method in different datasets and model architectures. Based on our experiment, we can achieve a maximum $37.7\\%$ attack error reduction with $3.7\\%$ original accuracy loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis on robust training of SNNs."}}

The current standard method for designing physical adversarial patches, i.e. Expectation over Transformations (EoT), simulates real-world environments by random physical transformations, resulting in adversarial examples far from satisfactory. To tackle this issue, we propose and develop a novel network to learn real-world physical transformations from data, including geometric transformation, printer color transformation and illumination adaption. Our approach produces realisticlooking adversarial examples and can be integrated into existing attack generation frameworks to generate adversarial patches effectively. We apply our approach to design adversarial T-shirts worn by moving people, one of the most challenging settings for physical attacks. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the arts when attacking DL-based object detectors in real life. Moreover, we build a first-kind-of adversarial T-shirts dataset to enable effective training of our approach and facilitate fair comparison on physical world attacks by considering a standard patch size, environment changes and object variances. Our code will be made publicly available."}}

Most existing attacks find adversarial examples via searching in the input space, e.g., using gradient descent. In this work, we formulate an adversarial attack using a branch-and-bound (BaB) procedure on ReLU neural networks and search adversarial examples in the activation space corresponding to binary variables in a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation. This attack formulation can be used to tackle hard instances where none of the existing adversarial attacks can succeed. Existing attacks using this formulation rely on generic solvers which cannot exploit the structure of neural networks and also cannot utilize GPU acceleration, so they are mostly limited to small networks and easy problem instances. To improve its scalability and practicability, we propose a top-down beam-search approach to quickly identify the subspace that may contain adversarial examples. The search utilizes the bound propagation based neural network verifiers on GPUs to rapidly evaluate a large number of searching regions, which is not possible in generic MIP solvers. Moreover, we exploit the fact that good candidates of adversarial examples can be easily found via gradient based attacks, and build an adversarial candidates pool to further guide the search in activation space via diving techniques. Additionally, any candidate adversarial examples found during the process are refined using a bottom-up large neighbourhood search (LNS) guided by the candidates pool. Our adversarial attack framework, BaB-Attack, opens up a new opportunity for designing novel adversarial attacks not limited to searching the input space, and enables us to borrow techniques from integer programming theory and neural network verification to build stronger attacks. In experiments, we can successfully generate adversarial examples for hard input instances where existing strong adversarial attacks fail, and outperform off-the-shelf MIP solver based attacks in both success rates and efficiency. Our results further close the gap between the upper bound of robust accuracy obtained by attacks and the lower bound obtained by verification."}}

Existing certified defenses towards adversarial patch attacks work well on small images like MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, but achieve very poor certified accuracy on higher-resolution images like ImageNet. It is urgent to design both robust and effective defenses against such a practical and harmful attack in industry-level larger images. In this work, we propose the certified defense methodology that achieves high provable robustness for high-resolution images and largely improves the practicality for real adoption of the certified defense. The basic insight of our work is that the adversarial patch intends to leverage localized superficial important neurons (SIN) to manipulate the prediction results. Hence, we leverage the SIN-based DNN compression techniques to significantly improve the certified accuracy, by reducing the adversarial region searching overhead and filtering the prediction noises. Our experimental results show that the certified accuracy is increased from 36.3%  (the state-of-the-art certified detection)  to 60.4%on the ImageNet dataset, largely pushing the certified defenses for practical use.
