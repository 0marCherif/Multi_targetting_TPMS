However, in many real-world scenarios, individual data points can be grouped together (e.g., people within households, taxi trips per driver, etc.), begging the question---what statistical properties (or queries) are important when considering data of this form? In addition, although synthetic data generation approaches for private query release have grown increasingly popular, it is unclear how one can generate synthetic data at both the group and individual-level while capturing such statistical properties. In light of these challenges, we formalize the problem of hierarchical query release and provide a set of statistical queries that capture relationships between attributes at both the group and individual-level. Furthermore, we propose and implement a novel synthetic data generation algorithm, H-GEM, which outputs hierarchical data subject to differential privacy to answer such statistical queries. Finally, using the American Community Survey, we evaluate H-GEM, establishing a benchmark for future work to measure against"}}

We first present an algorithmic framework that unifies a long line of iterative algorithms in the literature. Under this framework, we propose two new methods. The first method, private entropy projection (PEP), can be viewed as an advanced variant of MWEM that adaptively reuses past query measurements to boost accuracy. Our second method, generative networks with the exponential mechanism (GEM), circumvents computational bottlenecks in algorithms such as MWEM and PEP by optimizing over generative models parameterized by neural networks, which capture a rich family of distributions while enabling fast gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate that PEP and GEM empirically outperform existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show that GEM nicely incorporates prior information from public data while overcoming limitations of PMW^Pub, the existing state-of-the-art method that also leverages public data."}}
