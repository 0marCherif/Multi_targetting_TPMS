However, measuring a large number of environmental factors at high granularity might not always be feasible. Instead, here we propose extracting cellular embedding of environmental factors from gene expression data by using latent variable (LV) analysis and taking these LVs as environmental proxies in detecting gene-by-environment (GxE) interaction effects on gene expression, i.e., GxE expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Applying this approach to two largest brain eQTL datasets (n = 1,100), we show that LVs and GxE eQTLs in one dataset replicate well in the other dataset. Combining the two samples via meta-analysis, 895 GxE eQTLs are identified. On average, GxE effect explains an additional \u223c4% variation in expression of each gene that displays a GxE effect. Ten of these 52 genes are associated with cell-type-specific eQTLs, and the remaining genes are multi-functional. Furthermore, after substituting LVs with expression of transcription factors (TF), we found 91 TF-specific eQTLs, which demonstrates an important use of our brain GxE eQTLs."}}

Leveraging a granular atlas of chromatin accessibility across 81 immune cell types, we asked if a convolutional neural network (CNN) could learn to infer cell type-specific chromatin accessibility solely from regulatory DNA sequences. With a tailored architecture and an ensemble approach to CNN parameter interpretation, we show that our trained network (\u201cAI-TAC\u201d) does so by rediscovering ab initio the binding motifs for known regulators and some unknown ones. Motifs whose importance is learned virtually as functionally important overlap strikingly well with positions determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation for several TFs. AI-TAC establishes a hierarchy of TFs and their interactions that drives lineage specification and also identifies stage-specific interactions, like Pax5/Ebf1 vs. Pax5/Prdm1, or the role of different NF-\u03baB dimers in different cell types. AI-TAC assigns Spi1/Cebp and Pax5/Ebf1 as the drivers necessary for myeloid and B lineage fates, respectively, but no factors seemed as dominantly required for T cell differentiation, which may represent a fall-back pathway. Mouse-trained AI-TAC can parse human DNA, revealing a strikingly similar ranking of influential TFs and providing additional support that AI-TAC is a generalizable regulatory sequence decoder. Thus, deep learning can reveal the regulatory syntax predictive of the full differentiative complexity of the immune system."}}

Because composition of constituent cell-types can vary across individuals (due to technical or biological factors), differential gene expression analysis requires estimating and adjusting for such cellular heterogeneity. While many deconvolution algorithms for estimating cellular composition from tissue gene expression data have been tested extensively in blood, their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. To address this gap, we generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain, in order to apply and then assess deconvolution algorithms for application to brain gene expression datasets. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. Further, we show that adjusting for estimated cell-type proportions across individuals when conducting differential gene expression analysis is important in reducing false associations."}}

However, few of these methods exploit the intrinsic properties of brain networks other than modularity to tackle the pronounced noise in neuroimaging data. We propose a random walker (RW) based approach that reflects how regions of a brain subnetwork tend to be inter-linked by a provincial hub. By using provincial hubs to guide seed setting, RW provides the exact posterior probability of a brain region belonging to each given subnetwork, which mitigates forced hard assignments of brain regions to subnetworks as is the case in most existing methods. We further present an extension that enables multimodal integration for exploiting complementary information from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. On synthetic data, our approach achieves higher accuracy in subnetwork extraction than unimodal and existing multimodal approaches.

Most community detection techniques are designed for generating partitions, but certain brain regions are known to interact with multiple subnetworks. Thus, the brain's underlying subnetworks necessarily overlap. In this paper, we propose a technique for identifying overlapping subnetworks from weighted graphs with statistical control over false node inclusion. Our technique improves upon the replicator dynamics formulation by incorporating a graph augmentation strategy to enable subnetwork overlaps, and a graph incrementation scheme for merging subnetworks that might be falsely split by replicator dynamics due to its stringent mutual similarity criterion in defining subnetworks. To statistically control for inclusion of false nodes into the detected subnetworks, we further present a procedure for integrating stability selection into our subnetwork identification technique. We refer to the resulting technique as stable overlapping replicator dynamics (SORD). Our experiments on synthetic data show significantly higher accuracy in subnetwork identification with SORD than several state-of-the-art techniques. We also demonstrate higher test-retest reliability in multiple network measures on the Human Connectome Project data. Further, we illustrate that SORD enables identification of neuroanatomically-meaningful subnetworks and network hubs."}}

However, reliable extraction from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains challenging. As representations of brain networks, brain graph estimates are typically noisy due to the pronounced noise in fMRI data. Also, confounds, such as region size bias, motion artifacts, and signal dropout, introduce region-specific bias in connectivity, e.g. a node in a signal dropout area tends to display lower connectivity. The traditional approach of global thresholding might thus remove relevant edges that have low connectivity due to confounds, resulting in erroneous subnetwork extraction. In this paper, we present a modularity reinforcement strategy that deals with the above two challenges. Specifically, we propose a local thresholding scheme that accounts for region-specific connectivity bias when pruning noisy edges. From the resulting thresholded graph, we derive a node similarity measure by comparing the adjacency structure of each node, i.e. its connection fingerprint, with that of other nodes. Drawing on the intuition that nodes belonging to the same subnetwork should have similar connection fingerprints, we refine the brain graph with this similarity measure to reinforce its modularity structure. On synthetic data, our strategy achieves higher accuracy in subnetwork extraction compared to using standard brain graph estimates. On real data, subnetworks extracted with our strategy attain higher overlaps with well-established brain systems and higher subnetwork reproducibility across a range of graph densities. Our results thus demonstrate that modularity reinforcement with our strategy provides a clear gain in subnetwork extraction."}}
