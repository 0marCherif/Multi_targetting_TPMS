Recently, there is a surge of interest in modeling spatial relations between variables as graphs, i.e., first learning one static graph for each dataset and then exploiting the graph structure via graph neural networks. However, as spatial relations may differ substantially across samples, building one static graph for all the samples inherently limits flexibility and severely degrades the performance in practice. To address this issue, we propose a framework for fine-grained modeling and utilization of spatial correlation between variables. By analyzing the statistical properties of real-world datasets, a universal decomposition of spatial correlation graphs is first identified. Specifically, the hidden spatial relations can be decomposed into a prior part, which applies across all the samples, and a dynamic part, which varies between samples, and building different graphs is necessary to model these relations. To better coordinate the learning of the two relational graphs, we propose a min-max learning paradigm that not only regulates the common part of different dynamic graphs but also guarantees spatial distinguishability among samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on both time-series forecasting and time-series point prediction tasks."}}

Despite their promising performance, it is hard for deep neural networks to provide biological insights for humans due to their black-box nature. Recently, some works integrated biological knowledge with neural networks to improve the transparency and performance of their models. However, these methods can only incorporate partial biological knowledge, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose the Biological Factor Regulatory Neural Network (BFReg-NN), a generic framework to model relations among biological factors in cell systems. BFReg-NN starts from gene expression data and is capable of merging most existing biological knowledge into the model, including the regulatory relations among genes or proteins (e.g., gene regulatory networks (GRN), protein-protein interaction networks (PPI)) and the hierarchical relations among genes, proteins and pathways (e.g., several genes/proteins are contained in a pathway). Moreover, BFReg-NN also has the ability to provide new biologically meaningful insights because of its white-box characteristics. Experimental results on different gene expression-based tasks verify the superiority of BFReg-NN compared with baselines. Our case studies also show that the key insights found by BFReg-NN are consistent with the biological literature."}}

Due to the prevalence of temporal graphs, many temporal graph models have been proposed, but explaining their predictions remains to be explored. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose T-GNNExplainer for temporal graph model explanation. Specifically, we regard a temporal graph constituted by a sequence of temporal events. Given a target event, our task is to find a subset of previously occurred events that lead to the model's prediction for it. To handle this combinatorial optimization problem, T-GNNExplainer includes an explorer to find the event subsets with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)  and a navigator that learns the correlations between events and helps reduce the search space. In particular, the navigator is trained in advance and then integrated with the explorer to speed up searching and achieve better results. To the best of our knowledge, T-GNNExplainer is the first explainer tailored for temporal graph models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of T-GNNExplainer. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that T-GNNExplainer can achieve superior performance with up to about 50% improvement in Area under Fidelity-Sparsity Curve.

Recent advances in neuroscience revealed that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different types of machine learning tasks. \nIn this paper, we propose a new type of neural network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs.\nInspired by the locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. \nExperiments have demonstrated that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting tasks."}}

However, traditional community detection algorithms fail to pinpoint a particular kind of community. This limits its applicability in real-world networks, e.g., distinguishing fraud groups from normal ones in transaction networks. Recently, semi-supervised community detection emerges as a solution. It aims to seek other similar communities in the network with few labeled communities as training data. Existing works can be regarded as seed-based: locate seed nodes and then develop communities around seeds. However, these methods are quite sensitive to the quality of selected seeds since communities generated around a mis-detected seed may be irrelevant. Besides, they have individual issues, e.g., inflexibility and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we propose CLARE, which consists of two key components, Community Locator and Community Rewriter. Our idea is that we can locate potential communities and then refine them. Therefore, the community locator is proposed for quickly locating potential communities by seeking subgraphs that are similar to training ones in the network. To further adjust these located communities, we devise the community rewriter. Enhanced by deep reinforcement learning, it suggests intelligent decisions, such as adding or dropping nodes, to refine community structures flexibly. Extensive experiments verify both the effectiveness and efficiency of our work compared with prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple real-world datasets."}}

Though many deep learning methods with sophisticated designs have achieved promising results, the black-box nature hinders their applications due to fairness, explainability, and compliance consideration. Rule-based systems are considered reliable in these sensitive scenarios. However, building a rule system is labor-intensive. Experts need to find informative statistics from user behavior sequences, design rules based on statistics and assign weights to each rule. In this paper, we bridge the gap between effective but black-box models and transparent rule models. We propose a two-stage method, RuDi, that distills the knowledge of black-box teacher models into rule-based student models. We design a Monte Carlo tree search-based statistics generation method that can provide a set of informative statistics in the first stage. Then statistics are composed into logical rules with our proposed neural logical networks by mimicking the outputs of teacher models. We evaluate RuDi on three real-world public datasets and an industrial dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness."}}

However, this procedure discards the structure of geometries and loses the high resolution of VG. Recently, another category of algorithms is proposed to recognize directly from the original VG format. But it is affected by the topological errors that can be filtered out by RG rendering. Instead of looking at one format, it is a good solution to utilize the formats of VG and RG together to avoid these shortcomings. Besides, we argue that the VG-to-RG rendering process is essential to effectively combine VG and RG information. By specifying the rules on how to transfer VG primitives to RG pixels, the rendering process depicts the interaction and correlation between VG and RG. As a result, we propose RendNet, a unified architecture for recognition on both 2D and 3D scenarios, which considers both VG/RG representations and exploits their interaction by incorporating the VG-to-RG rasterization process. Experiments show that Rend-Net can achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D and 3D object recognition tasks on various VG datasets."}}

Some existing methods amplify a node's neighborhood with multi-hop neighbors to include more nodes with homophily. However, it is a significant challenge to set personalized neighborhood sizes for different nodes. Further, for other homophilous nodes excluded in the neighborhood, they are ignored for information aggregation. To address these problems, we propose two models GloGNN and GloGNN++, which generate a node's embedding by aggregating information from global nodes in the graph. In each layer, both models learn a coefficient matrix to capture the correlations between nodes, based on which neighborhood aggregation is performed. The coefficient matrix allows signed values and is derived from an optimization problem that has a closed-form solution. We further accelerate neighborhood aggregation and derive a linear time complexity. We theoretically explain the models' effectiveness by proving that both the coefficient matrix and the generated node embedding matrix have the desired grouping effect. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our models against 11 other competitors on 15 benchmark datasets in a wide range of domains, scales and graph heterophilies. Experimental results show that our methods achieve superior performance and are also very efficient."}}

Generally, KPIs are aggregated along multiple dimensions and derived by complex calculations among fundamental metrics from the raw data. Once abnormal KPI values are observed, root cause analysis (RCA) can be applied to identify the reasons for anomalies, so that we can troubleshoot quickly. Recently, several automatic RCA techniques were proposed to localize the related dimensions (or a combination of dimensions) to explain the anomalies. However, their analyses are limited to the data on the abnormal metric and ignore the data of other metrics which are also related to the anomalies, leading to imprecise or even incorrect root causes. To this end, we propose a cross-metric multi-dimensional root cause analysis method, named CMMD, which consists of two key components: 1) relationship modeling, which utilizes graph neural network (GNN) to model the unknown complex calculation among metrics and aggregation function among dimensions from historical data; 2) root cause localization, which adopts the genetic algorithm to efficiently and effectively dive into the raw data and localize the abnormal dimension(s) once the KPI anomalies are detected. Experiments on synthetic datasets, real-world datasets and online production environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CMMD method compared with baselines. Currently, CMMD is running as an online service in Microsoft Azure."}}
