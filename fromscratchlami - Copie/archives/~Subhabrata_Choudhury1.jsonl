The method can extract objects form still images, but uses videos for supervision. While prior works have considered motion for segmentation, a key insight is that, while motion can be used to identify objects, not all objects are necessarily in motion: the absence of motion does not imply the absence of objects. Hence, our model learns to predict image regions that are likely to contain motion patterns characteristic of objects moving rigidly. It does not predict specific motion, which cannot be done unambiguously from a still image, but a distribution of possible motions, which includes the possibility that an object does not move at all. We demonstrate the advantage of this approach over its deterministic counterpart and show state-of-the-art unsupervised object segmentation performance on simulated and real-world benchmarks, surpassing methods that use motion even at test time. As our approach is applicable to variety of network architectures that segment the scenes, we also apply it to existing image reconstruction-based models showing drastic improvement.

However, compared to using appearance, it has some blind spots, such as the fact that objects become invisible if they do not move. In this work, we propose an approach that combines the strengths of motion-based and appearance-based segmentation. We propose to supervise an image segmentation network with the pretext task of predicting regions that are likely to contain simple motion patterns, and thus likely to correspond to objects. As the model only uses a single image as input, we can apply it in two settings: unsupervised video segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results for videos, and demonstrate the viability of our approach on still images containing novel objects. Additionally we experiment with different motion models and optical flow backbones and find the method to be robust to these change.

On the other hand, representation learning at part level has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to object part discovery and segmentation and make three contributions. First, we construct a proxy task through a set of objectives that encourages the model to learn a meaningful decomposition of the image into its parts. Secondly, prior work argues for reconstructing or clustering pre-computed features as a proxy to parts; we show empirically that this alone is unlikely to find meaningful parts; mainly because of their low resolution and the tendency of classification networks to spatially smear out information. We suggest that image reconstruction at the level of pixels can alleviate this problem, acting as a complementary cue. Lastly, we show that the standard evaluation based on keypoint regression does not correlate well with segmentation quality and thus introduce different metrics, NMI and ARI, that better characterize the decomposition of objects into parts. Our method yields semantic parts which are consistent across fine-grained but visually distinct categories, outperforming the state of the art on three benchmark datasets.

Nonetheless, we do have general image and language understanding capabilities that we use to match what we see to expert resources. This allows us to expand our knowledge and perform novel tasks without ad-hoc external supervision. On the contrary, machines have a much harder time consulting expert-curated knowledge bases unless trained specifically with that knowledge in mind. Thus, in this paper we consider a new problem: fine-grained image recognition without expert annotations, which we address by leveraging the vast knowledge available in web encyclopedias. First, we learn a model to describe the visual appearance of objects using non-expert image descriptions. We then train a fine-grained textual similarity model that matches image descriptions with documents on a sentence-level basis. We evaluate the method on two datasets and compare with several strong baselines and the state of the art in cross-modal retrieval. Code is available at: https://github.com/subhc/clever"}}
