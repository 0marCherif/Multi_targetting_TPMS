In hopes of enabling compositional generalization, various unsupervised learning algorithms have been proposed with inductive biases that aim to induce compositional structure in learned representations (e.g. disentangled representation and emergent language learning). In this work, we evaluate these unsupervised learning algorithms in terms of how well they enable \\textit{compositional generalization}. Specifically, our evaluation protocol focuses on whether or not it is easy to train a simple model on top of the learned representation that generalizes to new combinations of compositional factors. We systematically study three unsupervised representation learning algorithms - $\\beta$-VAE, $\\beta$-TCVAE, and emergent language (EL) autoencoders - on two datasets that allow directly testing compositional generalization. We find that directly using the bottleneck representation with simple models and few labels may lead to worse generalization than using representations from layers before or after the learned representation itself. In addition, we find that the previously proposed metrics for evaluating the levels of compositionality are not correlated with actual compositional generalization in our framework. Surprisingly, we find that increasing pressure to produce a disentangled representation (e.g. increasing $\\beta$ in the $\\beta$-VAE) produces representations with worse generalization, while representations from EL models show strong compositional generalization. Motivated by this observation, we further investigate the advantages of using EL to induce compositional structure in unsupervised representation learning, finding that it shows consistently stronger generalization than disentanglement models, especially when using less unlabeled data for unsupervised learning and fewer labels for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results shed new light onto the compositional generalization behavior of different unsupervised learning algorithms with a new setting to rigorously test this behavior, and suggest the potential benefits of developing EL learning algorithms for more generalizable representations.

The recent success of Transformers on various vision tasks has paved the road for developing Transformer-based interactive image segmentation approaches. However, these approaches remain unexplored and, in particular, have not been developed for 3D medical image segmentation. To fill this research gap, we investigate Transformer-based interactive image segmentation and its application to 3D medical images. This is a nontrivial task due to two main challenges: 1) limited memory for computationally inefficient Transformers and 2) limited labels for 3D medical images. To tackle the first challenge, we propose iSegFormer, a memory-efficient Transformer that combines a Swin Transformer with a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder. To address the second challenge, we pretrain iSegFormer on large amount of unlabeled datasets and then finetune it with only a limited number of segmented 2D slices. We further propagate the 2D segmentations obtained by iSegFormer to unsegmented slices in 3D images using a pre-existing segmentation propagation model pretrained on videos. We evaluate iSegFormer on the public OAI-ZIB dataset for interactive knee cartilage segmentation. Evaluation results show that iSegFormer outperforms its convolutional neural network (CNN) counterparts on interactive 2D knee cartilage segmentation, with competitive computational efficiency. When propagating the 2D interactive segmentations of 5 slices to other unprocessed slices within the same 3D volume, we achieve 82.2% Dice score for 3D knee cartilage segmentation.

A hierarchical backbone is the de-facto architecture for current methods. Recently, the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a competitive backbone for dense prediction tasks. This design allows the original ViT to be a foundation model that can be finetuned for downstream tasks without redesigning a hierarchical backbone for pretraining. Although this design is simple and has been proven effective, it has not yet been explored for interactive image segmentation. To fill this gap, we propose SimpleClick, the first interactive segmentation method that leverages a plain backbone. Based on the plain backbone, we introduce a symmetric patch embedding layer that encodes clicks into the backbone with minor modifications to the backbone itself. With the plain backbone pretrained as a masked autoencoder (MAE), SimpleClick achieves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, our method achieves 4.15 NoC@90 on SBD, improving 21.8% over the previous best result. Extensive evaluation on medical images demonstrates the generalizability of our method. We further develop an extremely tiny ViT backbone for SimpleClick and provide a detailed computational analysis, highlighting its suitability as a practical annotation tool."}}

However, dense contrastive representation learning methods such as DenseCL (Wang et al., 2021) can learn better representations for tasks requiring stronger spatial localization of features, such as multi-label classification, detection, and segmentation. In this work, we study how to improve the quality of the representations learned by DenseCL by modifying the training scheme and objective function, and propose DenseCL++. We also conduct several ablation studies to better understand the effects of: (i) various techniques to form dense negative pairs among augmentations of different images, (ii) cross-view dense negative and positive pairs, and (iii) an auxiliary reconstruction task. Our results show 3.5% and 4% mAP improvement over SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020a) andDenseCL in COCO multi-label classification. In COCO and VOC segmentation tasks, we achieve 1.8% and 0.7% mIoU improvements over SimCLR, respectively."}}

In contrast to existing methods, our framework generates anatomically meaningful images via interpolation from the geodesic subspace underlying given samples. Our approach consists of three steps: 1) given a source image and a set of target images, we construct a geodesic subspace using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model; 2) we sample transformations from the resulting geodesic subspace; 3) we obtain deformed images and segmentations via interpolation. Experiments on brain (LPBA) and knee (OAI) data illustrate the performance of our approach on two tasks: 1) data augmentation during training and testing for image segmentation; 2) one-shot learning for single atlas image segmentation. We demonstrate that our approach generates anatomically meaningful data and improves performance on these tasks over competing approaches.
