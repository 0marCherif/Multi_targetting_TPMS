Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR) systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1) detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network, where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g. green-sunglasses or redbowtie) with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a na\u00efve brute force baseline achieves 56% accuracy."}}

Such setting is inevitable in real world--owing to the heavy tailed distribution of the visual categories, there would be some objects which would not be annotated in the train set. We show that the performance of two popular existing methods drop significantly (21-28%) when evaluated on novel objects cf. known objects. We propose methods which use large existing external corpora of (i) unlabeled text, ie books, and (ii) images tagged with classes, to achieve novel object based visual question answering. We systematically study both, an oracle case where the novel objects are known textually, as well as a fully automatic case without any explicit knowledge of the novel objects, but with the minimal assumption that the novel objects are semantically related to the existing objects in training. The proposed methods for novel object based visual question answering are modular and can potentially be used with many visual question answering architectures. We show consistent improvements with the two popular architectures and give qualitative analysis of the cases where the model does well and of those where it fails to bring improvements."}}

Recent work shows that in the case of single hidden-layer linear networks, Dropout is a stochastic gradient descent method for minimizing a regularized loss, and that the regularizer induces solutions that are low-rank and balanced. In this work we show that for single hidden-layer linear networks, DropBlock induces spectral k-support norm regularization, and promotes solutions that are low-rank and have factors with equal norm. We also show that the global minimizer for DropBlock can be computed in closed form, and that DropConnect is equivalent to Dropout.

However, it has remained unclear as to whether there are conditions under which no better attacks or defenses can be proposed. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for studying attacks and defenses which exist in equilibrium. Under a locally linear decision boundary model for the underlying binary classifier, we prove that the Fast Gradient Method attack and a Randomized Smoothing defense form a Nash Equilibrium. We then show how this equilibrium defense can be approximated given finitely many samples from a data-generating distribution, and derive a generalization bound for the performance of our approximation."}}

In this paper, we review multiple such fooling algorithms and show that the generated adversarial samples exhibit distributions largely different from the true distribution of the training samples, and thus are easily detectable by a simple meta classifier. We argue that for truly practical DNN fooling, not only should the adversarial samples be robust against various distortions, but must also follow the training set distribution and be undetectable from such meta classifiers.

However, this unification is not a panacea; it will expose new attack surfaces and vectors, just as it enables new applications. We therefore urgently need a model of security in the Internet of Things. In this regard, we note that IoT descends directly from pre-existing research (in embedded Internet and pervasive intelligence), so there exist several bodies of related work: security in RFID, sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and so on. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on RFID and WSN security, as a step to compiling all known attacks and defenses relevant to the Internet of Things."}}

As a result, research on the subject is still organized around these pre-existing areas: distributed computing with services and objects, networks (usually combining 6lowpan with Zigbee etc. for the last-hop), artificial intelligence and semantic web, and human-computer interaction. We are yet to create a unified model that covers all these perspectives - domain, device, service, agent, etc. In this paper, we propose the concept of cells as units of structure and context in the Internet of things. This allows us to have a unified vocabulary to refer to single entities (whether dumb motes, intelligent spimes, or virtual services), intranets of things, and finally the complete Internet of things. The question that naturally follows, is what criteria we choose to demarcate boundaries; we suggest various possible answers to this question. We also mention how this concept ties into the existing visions and protocols, and suggest how it may be used as the foundation of a formal model."}}
