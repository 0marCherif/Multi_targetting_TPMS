We present the first algorithm with provably vanishing regret for CBCR without restrictions on the policy space, whereas prior works were restricted to finite policy spaces or tabular representations. Our solution is based on a geometric interpretation of CBCR algorithms as optimization algorithms over the convex set of expected rewards spanned by all stochastic policies. Building on Frank-Wolfe analyses in constrained convex optimization, we derive a novel reduction from the CBCR regret to the regret of a \\emph{scalar-reward} bandit problem. We illustrate how to apply the reduction off-the-shelf to obtain algorithms for CBCR with both linear and general reward functions, in the case of non-combinatorial actions. Motivated by fairness in recommendation, we describe a special case of CBCR with rankings and fairness-aware objectives, leading to the first algorithm with regret guarantees for contextual combinatorial bandits with fairness of exposure."}}

While the primary concern in this domain is usually to find \\textit{realizable} representations (i.e., those that allow predicting the reward function at any context-action pair exactly), it has been recently shown that representations with certain spectral properties (called \\textit{HLS}) may be more effective for the exploration-exploitation task, enabling \\textit{LinUCB} to achieve constant (i.e., horizon-independent) regret. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{BanditSRL}, a representation learning algorithm that combines a novel constrained optimization problem to learn a realizable representation with good spectral properties with a generalized likelihood ratio test to exploit the recovered representation and avoid excessive exploration. We prove that \\textsc{BanditSRL} can be paired with any no-regret algorithm and achieve constant regret whenever an \\textit{HLS} representation is available. Furthermore, \\textsc{BanditSRL} can be easily combined with deep neural networks and we show how regularizing towards \\textit{HLS} representations is beneficial in standard benchmarks."}}

This setting is particular relevant in real-world domains including digital marketing, healthcare, production, finance, etc. In this paper, we present a reduction-based framework for conservative bandits and RL, in which our core technique is to calculate the necessary and sufficient budget obtained from running the baseline policy. For lower bounds, we improve the existing lower bound for conservative multi-armed bandits and obtain new lower bounds for conservative linear bandits, tabular RL and low-rank MDP, through a black-box reduction that turns a certain lower bound in the nonconservative setting into a new lower bound in the conservative setting.  For upper bounds, in multi-armed bandits, linear bandits and tabular RL, our new upper bounds tighten or match existing ones with significantly simpler analyses. We also obtain a new upper bound for conservative low-rank MDP."}}

Whether we optimize for regret, sample complexity, state-space coverage or model estimation, we need to strike a different exploration-exploitation trade-off. In this paper, we propose to tackle the exploration-exploitation problem following a decoupled approach composed of: 1) An \"objective-specific\" algorithm that (adaptively) prescribes how many samples to collect at which states, as if it has access to a generative model (i.e., a simulator of the environment); 2) An \"objective-agnostic\" sample collection exploration strategy responsible for generating the prescribed samples as fast as possible. Building on recent methods for exploration in the stochastic shortest path problem, we first provide an algorithm that, given as input the number of samples $b(s,a)$ needed in each state-action pair, requires $\\widetilde{O}(B D + D^{3/2} S^2 A)$ time steps to collect the $B=\\sum_{s,a} b(s,a)$ desired samples, in any unknown communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and diameter $D$. Then we show how this general-purpose exploration algorithm can be paired with \"objective-specific\" strategies that prescribe the sample requirements to tackle a variety of settings \u2014 e.g., model estimation, sparse reward discovery, goal-free cost-free exploration in communicating MDPs \u2014 for which we obtain improved or novel sample complexity guarantees."}}

In these domains it is common that user data contains sensitive information that needs to be protected from third parties. Motivated by this, we study privacy in the context of finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by requiring information to be obfuscated on the user side. We formulate this notion of privacy for RL by leveraging the local differential privacy (LDP) framework. We establish a lower bound for regret minimization in finite-horizon MDPs with LDP guarantees which shows that guaranteeing privacy has a multiplicative effect on the regret. This result shows that while LDP is an appealing notion of privacy, it makes the learning problem significantly more complex. Finally, we present an optimistic algorithm that simultaneously satisfies $\\varepsilon$-LDP requirements, and achieves $\\sqrt{K}/\\varepsilon$ regret in any finite-horizon MDP after $K$ episodes,  matching the lower bound dependency on the number of episodes $K$."}}

While, similar to prior work (e.g., for ergodic MDPs), the lower-bound is the solution to an optimization problem, our derivation reveals the need for an additional constraint on the visitation distribution over state-action pairs that explicitly accounts for the dynamics of the MDP. We provide a characterization of our lower-bound through a series of examples illustrating how different MDPs may have significantly different complexity. 1) We first consider a \"difficult\" MDP instance, where the novel constraint based on the dynamics leads to a larger lower-bound (i.e., a larger regret) compared to the classical analysis. 2) We then show that our lower-bound recovers results previously derived for specific MDP instances. 3) Finally, we show that, in certain \"simple\" MDPs, the lower bound is considerably smaller than in the general case and it does not scale with the minimum action gap at all. We show that this last result is attainable (up to $poly(H)$ terms, where $H$ is the horizon) by providing a regret upper-bound based on policy gaps for an optimistic algorithm."}}
