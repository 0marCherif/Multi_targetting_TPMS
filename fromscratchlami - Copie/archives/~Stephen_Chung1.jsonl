We consider multi-demonstrator offline RL, a middle ground where we know which demonstrators generated each dataset, but make no assumptions about the underlying policies of the demonstrators. This is the most natural setting when collecting data from multiple human operators, yet remains unexplored. Since different demonstrators induce different data distributions, we show that this can be naturally framed as a domain generalization problem, with each demonstrator corresponding to a different domain. Specifically, we propose Domain-Invariant Model-based Offline RL (DIMORL), where we apply Risk Extrapolation (REx) (Krueger et al., 2020) to the process of learning dynamics and rewards models. Our results show that models trained with REx exhibit improved domain generalization performance when compared with the natural baseline of pooling all demonstrators' data. We observe that the resulting models frequently enable the learning of superior policies in the offline model-based RL setting, can improve the stability of the policy learning process, and potentially enable increased exploration."}}

However, in the proofs, the RNNs allow for neurons with unbounded precision, which is neither practical in implementation nor biologically plausible. To remove this assumption, we propose a dynamically growing memory module made of neurons of fixed precision. The memory module dynamically recruits new neurons when more memories are needed, and releases them when memories become irrelevant. We prove that a 54-neuron bounded-precision RNN with growing memory modules can simulate a Universal Turing Machine, with time complexity linear in the simulated machine's time and independent of the memory size. The result is extendable to various other stack-augmented RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the Turing completeness of both unbounded-precision and bounded-precision RNNs, revisiting and extending the theoretical foundations of RNNs."}}

An alternative way of training an artificial neural network is through treating each unit in the network as a reinforcement learning agent, and thus the network is considered as a team of agents. As such, all units can be trained by REINFORCE, a local learning rule modulated by a global signal that is more consistent with biologically observed forms of synaptic plasticity. Although this learning rule follows the gradient of return in expectation, it suffers from high variance and thus the low speed of learning, rendering it impractical to train deep networks. We therefore propose a novel algorithm called MAP propagation to reduce this variance significantly while retaining the local property of the learning rule. Experiments demonstrated that MAP propagation could solve common reinforcement learning tasks at a similar speed to backpropagation when applied to an actor-critic network. Our work thus allows for the broader application of teams of agents in deep reinforcement learning. "}}
