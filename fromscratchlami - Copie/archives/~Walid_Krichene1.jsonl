One important aspect of the problem, that can significantly impact quality, is the distribution skew among tasks. Certain tasks may have much fewer data samples than others, making them more susceptible to the noise added for privacy. It is natural to ask whether algorithms can adapt to this skew to improve the overall utility.   We give a systematic analysis of the problem, by studying how to optimally allocate a user's privacy budget among tasks. We propose a generic algorithm, based on an adaptive reweighting of the empirical loss, and show that when there is task distribution skew, this gives a quantifiable improvement of excess empirical risk.   Experimental studies on recommendation problems that exhibit a long tail of small tasks, demonstrate that our methods significantly improve utility, achieving the state of the art on two standard benchmarks."}}

It powers recommender systems such as Spotify, Instagram and YouTube, and health-care systems via models that predict sleep patterns, or the risk of disease. Individuals contribute data to these models and benefit from them. Are these contributions (outflows of influence) and benefits (inflows of influence) reciprocal? We propose measures of outflows, inflows and reciprocity building on previously proposed measures of training data influence. Our initial theoretical and empirical results indicate that under certain distributional assumptions, some classes of models are approximately reciprocal. We conclude with several open directions."}}

Our design allows for efficient use of the TPU architecture and scales well to matrix factorization problems of O(B) rows/columns by scaling the number of available TPU cores. In order to spur future research on large scale matrix factorization methods and to illustrate the scalability properties of our own implementation, we also built a real world web link prediction dataset called WebGraph. This dataset can be easily modeled as a matrix factorization problem. We created several variants of this dataset based on locality and sparsity properties of sub-graphs. The largest variant of WebGraph has around 365M nodes and training a single epoch finishes in about 20 minutes with 256 TPU cores. We include speed and performance numbers of ALX on all variants of WebGraph. Both the framework code and the dataset is open-sourced."}}

Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated using ranking metrics that depend on the positions of relevant items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates sampled metrics in more detail and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact version, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. Moreover, the smaller the sampling size, the less difference there is between metrics, and for very small sampling size, all metrics collapse to the AUC metric. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction, obtained by minimizing different criteria such as bias or mean squared error. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. To summarize, our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the quality of the estimate."}}

These results were derived for first-order gradient flow, and a natural question is whether second-order dynamics, i.e., dynamics with momentum, exhibit a similar guarantee. We show that the answer is positive for the heavy ball method. In this case, the resulting integro-PDE is a nonlinear kinetic Fokker Planck equation, and unlike the first-order case, it has no apparent connection with the Wasserstein gradient flow. Instead, we study the variations of a Lyapunov functional along the solution trajectories to characterize the stationary points and to prove convergence. While our results are asymptotic in the mean field limit, numerical simulations indicate that global convergence may already occur for reasonably small networks."}}

Traditionally, the dot product or higher order equivalents have been used to combine two or more embeddings, e.g., most notably in matrix factorization. In recent years, it was suggested to replace the dot product with a learned similarity e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice."}}

This is achieved by applying hash functions to map each id to multiple hash tokens in a much smaller space, similarly to a Bloom filter. We show that by applying a multi-layer Transformer to these Bloom filter digests, we are able to obtain models with high accuracy. They outperform models of a similar size without hashing and, to a large degree, models of a much larger size trained using sampled softmax with the same computational budget. Our key observation is that it is important to use a multi-layer Transformer for Bloom filter digests to remove ambiguity in the hashed input. We believe this provides an alternative method to solving problems with large vocabulary size."}}
