However, in reinforcement learning, even for supervised sub-problems such as world model learning, early stopping is not applicable as the dataset is continually evolving. As a solution, we propose a new general method that dynamically adjusts the update to data (UTD) ratio during training based on under- and overfitting detection on a small subset of the continuously collected experience not used for training. We apply our method to DreamerV2, a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and evaluate it on the DeepMind Control Suite and the Atari 100k benchmark. The results demonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting the UTD ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in DreamerV2 and that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not feasible for many applications. Our method eliminates the need to set the UTD hyperparameter by hand and even leads to a higher robustness with regard to other learning-related hyperparameters further reducing the amount of necessary tuning."}}

Algorithms based on temporal difference learning typically are prone to an over- or underestimation bias building up over time. In this paper, we propose a general method called Adaptively Calibrated Critics (ACC) that uses the most recent high variance but unbiased on-policy rollouts to alleviate the bias of the low variance temporal difference targets. We apply ACC to Truncated Quantile Critics [22], which is an algorithm for continuous control that allows regulation of the bias with a hyperparameter tuned per environment. The resulting algorithm adaptively adjusts the parameter during training rendering hyperparameter search unnecessary and sets a new state of the art on the OpenAI gym continuous control benchmark among all algorithms that do not tune hyperparameters for each environment. Additionally, we demonstrate that ACC is quite general by further applying it to TD3 [11] and showing an improved performance also in this setting."}}

Many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic motivation to complement the sparse extrinsic reward signal, giving the agent more opportunities to receive feedback during exploration. Commonly these signals are added as bonus rewards, which results in a mixture policy that neither conducts exploration nor task fulfillment resolutely.\nIn this paper, we instead learn separate intrinsic and extrinsic task policies and schedule between these different drives to accelerate exploration and stabilize learning. Moreover, we introduce a new type of intrinsic reward denoted as successor feature control (SFC), which is general and not task-specific. It takes into account statistics over complete trajectories and thus differs from previous methods that only use local information to evaluate intrinsic motivation. We evaluate our proposed scheduled intrinsic drive (SID) agent using three different environments with pure visual inputs: VizDoom, DeepMind Lab and DeepMind Control Suite. The results show a substantially improved exploration efficiency with SFC and the hierarchical usage of the intrinsic drives.

However, the combination of function approximation, temporal difference (TD) learning and off-policy training can lead to an overestimating value function. A solution is to use Clipped Double Q-learning (CDQ), which is used in the TD3 algorithm and computes the minimum of two critics in the TD-target. \nWe show that CDQ induces an underestimation bias and propose a new algorithm that accounts for this by using a weighted average of the target from CDQ and the target coming from a single critic.\nThe weighting parameter is adjusted during training such that the value estimates match the actual discounted return on the most recent episodes and by that it balances over- and underestimation.\nEmpirically, we obtain more accurate value estimates and demonstrate state of the art results on several OpenAI gym tasks."}}
