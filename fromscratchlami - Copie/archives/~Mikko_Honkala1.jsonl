However, collecting and annotating large datasets can be a very cumbersome and expensive task. We tackle these problems with a virtual database approach where training data is generated using computer simulations of related phenomena. Specifically, we concentrate on the following problem: can cardiovascular indices such as aortic elasticity, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and blood flow from heart be predicted continuously using wearable photoplethysmographic sensors? We simulate the blood flow using a haemodynamic model consisting of the entire human circulation. Repeated evaluation of the simulator allows us to create a database of \u201cvirtual subjects\u201d with size that is only limited by available computational resources. Using this database, we train neural networks to predict the cardiac indices from photoplethysmographic signal waveform. We consider two approaches: neural networks based on predefined input features and deep convolutional neural networks taking waveform directly as the input. The performance of the methods is demonstrated using numerical examples, thus carrying out a preliminary assessment of the approaches. The results show improvements in accuracy compared with the previous methods. The improvements are especially significant with indices related to aortic elasticity and maximum blood flow. The proposed approach would provide new means to measure cardiovascular health continuously, for example, with a simple wrist device."}}

Despite the large amount of encouraging results, most works have not considered spatial multiplexing in the context of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) receivers. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based MIMO receiver architecture that consists of a ResNet-based convolutional neural network, also known as DeepRx, combined with a so-called transformation layer, all trained together. We propose two novel alternatives for the transformation layer: a maximal ratio combining-based transformation, or a fully learned transformation. The former relies more on expert knowledge, while the latter utilizes learned multiplicative layers. Both proposed transformation layers are shown to clearly outperform the conventional baseline receiver, especially with sparse pilot configurations. To the best of our knowledge, these are some of the first results showing such high performance for a fully learned MIMO receiver."}}

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepRx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols. Also, DeepRx outputs soft bits that are compatible with the channel coding used in 5G systems. Using 3GPP-defined channel models, we demonstrate that DeepRx outperforms traditional methods. We also show that the high performance can likely be attributed to DeepRx learning to utilize the known constellation points of the unknown data symbols, together with the local symbol distribution, for improved detection accuracy."}}

VLN is a neural encoder-decoder model augmented at all layers by both recurrent and feedforward lateral connections. At each layer, these connections form a lateral recurrent residual block, where the feedforward connection represents a skip connection and the recurrent connection represents the residual. Thanks to the recurrent connections, the decoder can exploit temporal summaries generated from all layers of the encoder. This way, the top layer is relieved from the pressure of modeling lower-level spatial and temporal details. Furthermore, we extend the basic version of VLN to incorporate ResNet-style residual blocks in the encoder and decoder, which help improving the prediction results. VLN is trained in self-supervised regime on the Moving MNIST dataset, achieving competitive results while having very simple structure and providing fast inference."}}
