Conventional traffic simulators usually em- ploy a calibrated physical car-following model to describe vehicles\u2019 behaviors and their interactions with traffic environment. However, there is no uni- versal physical model that can accurately predict the pattern of vehicle\u2019s behaviors in different sit- uations. A fixed physical model tends to be less effective in a complicated environment given the non-stationary nature of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we formulate traffic simulation as an in- verse reinforcement learning problem, and propose a parameter sharing adversarial inverse reinforce- ment learning model for dynamics-robust simula- tion learning. Our proposed model is able to imi- tate a vehicle\u2019s trajectories in the real world while simultaneously recovering the reward function that reveals the vehicle\u2019s true objective which is invari- ant to different dynamics. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the su- perior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods and its robustness to vari- ant dynamics of traffic."}}

This paper presents the first end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting physician burnout based on electronic health record (EHR) activity logs, digital traces of physician work activities that are available in any EHR system. In contrast to prior approaches that exclusively relied on surveys for burnout measurement, our framework directly learns deep representations of physician behaviors from large-scale clinician activity logs to predict burnout. We propose the Hierarchical burnout Prediction based on Activity Logs (HiPAL), featuring a pre-trained time-dependent activity embedding mechanism tailored for activity logs and a hierarchical predictive model, which mirrors the natural hierarchical structure of clinician activity logs and captures physi- cians\u2019 evolving burnout risk at both short-term and long-term levels. To utilize the large amount of unlabeled activity logs, we propose a semi-supervised framework that learns to transfer knowledge extracted from unlabeled clinician activities to the HiPAL-based prediction model. The experiment on over 15 million clinician activity logs collected from the EHR at a large academic medical center demonstrates the advantages of our proposed framework in predictive performance of physician burnout and training efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches."}}

But the dimensionality after reduction is inevitably restricted to the number of classes, and the learned non-orthogonal projection matrix usually fails to preserve distances well and balance the weight on different projection direction. This paper proposes a novel dimensionality reduction method, called the semi-supervised orthogonal graph embedding with recursive projections (SOGE). We integrate the manifold smoothness and label fitness as well as the penalization of the linear mapping mismatch, and learn the orthogonal projection on the Stiefel manifold that empirically demonstrates better performance. Moreover, we recursively update the projection matrix in its orthocomplemented space to continuously learn more projection vectors, so as to better control the dimension of reduction. Comprehensive experiment on several benchmarks demonstrates the significant improvement over the existing methods."}}

A balanced clustering result is often required in a variety of applications. Many existing clustering algorithms have good clustering performances, yet fail in producing balanced clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method for clustering, referred to as the Balanced Clustering with Least Square regression (BCLS), to minimize the least square linear regression, with a balance constraint to regularize the clustering model. In BCLS, the linear regression is applied to estimate the class-specific hyperplanes that partition each class of data from others, thus guiding the clustering of the data points into different clusters. A balance constraint is utilized to regularize the clustering, by minimizing which can help produce balanced clusters. In addition, we apply the method of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) to help optimize the objective model. The experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only produces good clustering performance but also guarantees a balanced clustering result."}}
