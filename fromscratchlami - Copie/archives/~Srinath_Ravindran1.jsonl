Further, such information can serve as background knowledge for evaluating machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present part of our work towards developing such an understanding. We demonstrate a simple extraction technique and how the extracted data can be used to evaluate an unsupervised embedding model built on search queries with travel intent."}}

These issues continue to be important hurdles in machine intelligence and my doctoral thesis focuses on developing robust machine learning models that address the same."}}
