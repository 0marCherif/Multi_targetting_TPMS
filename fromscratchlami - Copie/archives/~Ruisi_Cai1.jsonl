This paper empirically suggests a surprisingly simple answer: linearly - by straightforward model weight arithmetic! We start by drawing several key observations: (1)assuming that we train the same model architecture on both a clean dataset and its corrupted version, resultant weights mostly differ in shallow layers; (2)the weight difference after projection, which we call \"Robust Weight Signature\" (RWS), appears to be discriminative and indicative of different corruption types; (3)for the same corruption type, the RWSs obtained by one model architecture are highly consistent and transferable across different datasets. We propose a minimalistic model robustness \"patching\" framework that carries a model trained on clean data together with its pre-extracted RWSs. In this way, injecting certain robustness to the model is reduced to directly adding the corresponding RWS to its weight. We verify our proposed framework to be remarkably (1)lightweight. since RWSs concentrate on the shallowest few layers and we further show they can be painlessly quantized, storing an RWS is up to 13 x more compact than storing the full weight copy; (2)in-situ adjustable. RWSs can be appended as needed and later taken off to restore the intact clean model. We further demonstrate one can linearly re-scale the RWS to control the patched robustness strength; (3)composable. Multiple RWSs can be added simultaneously to patch more comprehensive robustness at once; and (4)transferable. Even when the clean model backbone is continually adapted or updated, RWSs remain as effective patches due to their outstanding cross-dataset transferability."}}

Facing the data shortfall, one viable option is to acquire domain-specific training data from external uncensored sources, such as open webs or third-party data collectors. However, the quality of such acquired data is often not rigorously scrutinized, and one cannot easily rule out the risk of `\"poisoned\" examples being included in such unreliable datasets, resulting in unreliable trained models which pose potential risks to many high-stake applications. While existing options usually suffer from high computational costs or assumptions on clean data access, this paper attempts to detect backdoors for potential victim models with minimal prior knowledge. In particular, provided with a trained model, users are assumed to (1) have no prior knowledge of whether it is already poisoned, or what the target class/percentage of samples is poisoned, and (2) have no access to a clean sample set from the same training distribution, nor any trusted model trained on such clean data. To tackle this challenging scenario, we first observe the contrasting channel-level statistics between the backdoor trigger and clean image features, and consequently, how they can be differentiated by progressive channel shuffling. We then propose the randomized channel shuffling method for backdoor-targeted class detection, which requires only a few feed-forward passes. It thus incurs minimal overheads and demands no clean sample nor prior knowledge. We further explore a \u201cfull\u201d clean data-free setting, where neither the target class detection nor the trigger recovery can access the clean data. Extensive experiments are conducted with three datasets (CIFAR-10,  GTSRB, Tiny ImageNet), three architectures (AlexNet, ResNet-20, SENet-18), and three attacks (BadNets, clean label attack, and WaNet). Results consistently endorse the effectiveness of our proposed technique in backdoor model detection,  with margins of 0.291 \uff5e 0.640 AUROC over the current state-of-the-arts.
