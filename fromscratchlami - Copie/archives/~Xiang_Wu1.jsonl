Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the low-dimensional bottleneck in embedding-based methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that theoretically there is no limitation to using low-dimensional embedding-based methods, and provide experimental evidence that overfitting is the root cause of the poor performance of embedding-based methods. These findings motivate us to investigate novel data augmentation and regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting. To this end, we propose GLaS, a new regularizer for embedding-based neural network approaches. It is a natural generalization from the graph Laplacian and spread-out regularizers, and empirically it addresses the drawback of each regularizer alone when applied to the extreme classification setup. With the proposed techniques, we attain or improve upon the state-of-the-art on most widely tested public extreme classification datasets with hundreds of thousands of labels."}}

The key insight of the approach is that quantization methods, in particular product quantization, perform poorly when there is large variance in the norms of the data points. This is a common scenario for real- world datasets, especially when doing product quantization of residuals obtained from coarse vector quantization. To address this issue, we propose a multiscale formulation where we learn a separate scalar quantizer of the residual norm scales. All parameters are learned jointly in a stochastic gradient descent framework to minimize the overall quantization error. We provide theoretical motivation for the proposed technique and conduct comprehensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall over existing state-of-the-art methods."}}

Earlier studies target this problem by learning models that either generalize behaviors of the entire network population or capture behaviors of each individual user. In this paper, we claim that a novel approach based on group-level popularity is necessary and more practical, given that users naturally organize themselves into clusters and that users within a cluster react to online content in a uniform manner. We develop a novel framework by first grouping users into cohesive clusters, and then adopt tensor decomposition to make predictions. In order to minimize the impact of noisy data and be more flexible in capturing changes in users' interests, our framework exploits both the network topology and interaction among users in learning a robust user clustering. The PARAFAC tensor decomposition is adapted to work with hierarchical constraint over user groups, and we show that optimizing this constrained function via gradient descent achieves faster convergence and leads to more stable solutions. Extensive experimental results over two social networks demonstrate that our framework is scalable, finds meaningful user groups, and significantly outperforms eight baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy."}}
