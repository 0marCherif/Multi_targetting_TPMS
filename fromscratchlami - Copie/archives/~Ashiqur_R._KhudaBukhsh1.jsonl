The present era of ubiquitous social media has never seen nuclear powers closer to war. In this paper, we analyze this evolving international crisis via a substantial corpus constructed using comments on YouTube videos (921,235 English comments posted by 392,460 users out of 2.04 million overall comments by\n791,289 users on 2,890 videos). Our main contributions in the paper are three-fold. First, we present an observation that polyglot word embeddings reveal precise and accurate language clusters, and subsequently construct a document language identification technique with negligible annotation requirements. We demonstrate the viability and utility across a variety of data sets involving several low-resource languages. Second, we present an analysis on temporal trends of pro-peace and pro-war intent observing that when tensions between the two nations were at their peak, pro-peace intent in the corpus was at its highest point. Finally, in the context of heated discussions in a politically tense situation where two nations are at the brink of a full-fledged war, we argue the importance of automatic identification\nof user-generated web content that can diffuse hostility and address this prediction task, dubbed hope-speech detection."}}

Prominent lines of prior research across multiple disciplines have observed and analyzed growing polarization in social media. In this paper, we present a new methodology that offers a fresh perspective on interpreting polarization through the lens of machine translation. With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different \"languages\", we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words. Via a substantial corpus of 86.6 million comments by 6.5 million users on over 200,000 news videos hosted by YouTube channels of four prominent US news networks, we demonstrate that simple word-level and phrase-level translation pairs can reveal deep insights into the current political divide -- what is \"black lives matter\" to one can be \"all lives matter\" to the other."}}

Our dataset includes 625,409 dialogues containing interruptions found in 275,420 transcripts from CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC spanning between January 2000 and July 2021. From this large, unlabeled pool of interruptions, we release an annotated dataset consisting of 2,000 dialogues with fine-grained interruption labels. We use this dataset to train an interruption classifier and predict the interruption type of a given dialogue. Our results reveal that male speakers (in our collected samples) tend to talk more than female speakers, while female speakers interrupt more. Moreover, people tend to use less intrusive interruptions when talking to others sharing the same political belief. This pattern becomes more pronounced among news media with stronger political bias."}}

However, little or no literature exists that presented a unified treatment combining both these research directions. When working on social events from countries that do not speak English as a first language, computational linguistic resource availability is often a barrier to sophisticated linguistic analyses. In this work, we analyze an important sociopolitical event, the 2019 South American protests, and demonstrate that (1) a combined treatment offers a more comprehensive understanding of the event; and (2) these cross-cutting methods can be applied in a synergistic way. The insights gained by the combination of these methods include that polarization in users\u2019 news sharing patterns was consistent with their stances towards the government and that polarization in their language mainly manifested along ideological, political, or protest-related lines. In addition, we release a massive dataset of 15 million tweets relevant to this crisis."}}

During the administration of President Donald Trump, charges of \u201cfake news\u201d made social and news media not only the means but, to an unprecedented extent, the topic of political communication. This extreme political polarization continued through the election and all through the period up to the attempted takeover of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In this paper, we analyze this tumultuous phase in American history through the lens of news viewership. We consider the official YouTube channels of six US cable news networks across a wide political spectrum with a specific focus on three conservative fringe news networks. We analyze how the viewers reacted to the different ways the election outcome was covered by these news outlets. This paper makes two distinct types of contributions. The first is to introduce a novel methodology to analyze large social media data to study the dynamics of US news networks and their viewers. The second is to provide insights into what actually happened regarding these news networks and their viewerships during this volatile 64 day period. Our empirical evidence suggest that recent natural language processing advancements can be harnessed in a synergistic way to mine political insights from large scale social media data."}}

Consequently, YouTube Kids' content should receive an additional level of scrutiny to ensure children's safety. While research on detecting offensive or inappropriate content for kids is gaining momentum, little or no current work exists that investigates to what extent AI applications can (accidentally) introduce content that is inappropriate for kids. In this paper, we present a novel (and troubling) finding that well-known automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems may produce text content highly inappropriate for kids while transcribing YouTube Kids' videos. We dub this phenomenon as inappropriate content hallucination. Our analyses suggest that such hallucinations are far from occasional, and the ASR systems often produce them with high confidence. We release a first-of-its-kind data set of audios for which the existing state-of-the-art ASR systems hallucinate inappropriate content for kids. In addition, we demonstrate that some of these errors can be fixed using language models."}}

Such omissions are common due to the sheer mismatch between linguistic resources offered in a world language and its low-resource counterpart. However, during a global pandemic or an imminent war, demand for linguistic resources might get recalibrated. In this work, we focus on the high-resource and low-resource language pair $$\\langle en , hi _e \\rangle $$ (English, and Romanized Hindi) and present a cross-lingual sampling method that takes example documents in English, and retrieves similar content written in Romanized Hindi, the most popular form of Hindi observed in social media. At the core of our technique is a novel finding that a surprisingly simple constrained nearest-neighbor sampling in polyglot Skip-gram word embedding space can retrieve substantial bilingual lexicons, even from harsh social media data sets. Our cross-lingual sampling method obtains substantial performance improvement in the important domains of detecting peace-seeking, hostility-diffusing hope speech in the context of the 2019 India-Pakistan conflict, and in detecting comments encouraging compliance with COVID-19 guidelines."}}

We analyze 15,711 news articles and 1,231,379 Facebook posts about vaping to study the differences in framing between media varieties. We use word embeddings to provide two-dimensional visualizations of the semantic changes around vaping for news and for social media. We detail that news media framing of vaping shifted over time in line with emergent regulatory trends, such as; flavored vaping bans, with little discussion around vaping as a smoking cessation tool. We found that social media discussions were far more varied, with transitions toward vaping both as a public health harm and as a smoking cessation tool. Our cloze test, dynamic topic models, and question answering showed similar patterns, where social media, but not news media, characterizes vaping as combustible cigarette substitute. We use n-grams and LDA topic models to detail that social media data first centered on vaping as a smoking cessation tool, and in 2019 moved toward narratives around vaping regulation, similar to news media frames. Overall, social media tracks the evolution of vaping as a social practice, while news media reflects more risk based concerns. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other."}}

We cast the problem of aggregate stance mining as a natural language inference task and construct an active learning pipeline for robust textual entailment prediction. Via a substantial corpus of 34,710 news transcripts, our analyses reveal that the partisan divide in viewership of these three outlets reflects on the network's news coverage of these momentous events. In addition, we release a sentence-level, domain-specific text entailment data set on policing consisting of 2,276 annotated instances."}}
