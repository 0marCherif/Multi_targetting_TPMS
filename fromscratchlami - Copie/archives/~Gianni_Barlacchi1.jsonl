However, they require large amounts of manual annotations to perform competitively, which is infeasible to scale. To address this, a growing body of research works have recently focused on improving DR performance under low-resource scenarios. These works differ in what resources they require for training and employ a diverse set of techniques. Understanding such differences is crucial for choosing the right technique under a specific low-resource scenario. To facilitate this understanding, we provide a thorough structured overview of mainstream techniques for low-resource DR. Based on their required resources, we divide the techniques into three main categories: (1) only documents are needed; (2) documents and questions are needed; and (3) documents and question-answer pairs are needed. For every technique, we introduce its general-form algorithm, highlight the open issues and pros and cons. Promising directions are outlined for future research."}}

In this paper, we compare two types of QR approaches, generative and expansive QR, in end-to-end ODCQA systems with recently released QReCC and OR-QuAC benchmarks. While it is common practice to apply the same QR approach for both the retriever and the reader in the QA system, our results show such strategy is generally suboptimal and suggest expansive QR is better for the sparse retriever and generative QR is better for the reader. Furthermore, while conversation history modeling with dense representations outperforms QR, we show the advantages to apply both jointly, as QR boosts the performance especially when limited history turns are considered."}}

We model city areas using a hierarchical structure of POIs extracted from foursquare. We encode such structures in kernel machines, e.g., Support Vector Machines, using a new Tree Kernel, i.e., the Hierarchical POI Kernel (HPK), which can take the importance of the individual POIs into account during the substructure matching. This way, HPK projects structures in the space of all their possible substructures such that each dimension corresponds to a semantic structural feature, weighted according to the discriminative power of POIs . We generated four different datasets for the following cities: Barcelona, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Milan, where we trained and tested our models. The results show that our approach largely outperforms previous work and standard baseline built on simple features, such as counts of different POIs. Finally, we apply a mining algorithm to extract the most relevant features (tree fragments) from the implicit TK space according to the weights the kernel machine assigned to them. Our approach can produce an explicit set of representative features that can be used to classify and characterize urban areas."}}

When information about mobility flows is not available for a particular region of interest, we must rely on mathematical models to generate them. In this work, we propose the Deep Gravity model, an effective method to generate flow probabilities that exploits many variables (e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover non-linear relationships between those variables and mobility flows. Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity has good geographic generalization capability, achieving a significant increase in performance (especially in densely populated regions of interest) with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. We also show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features using explainable AI techniques."}}

Predicting the next location is a well-studied problem in human mobility, which finds several applications in real-world scenarios, from optimizing the efficiency of electronic dispatching systems to predicting and reducing the traffic jam. This task is normally modeled as a multiclass classification problem, where the goal is to select, among a set of already known locations, the next taxi destination. We present a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach that models the taxi drivers' behavior and encodes the semantics of visited locations by using geographical information from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). In particular, the RNNs are trained to predict the exact coordinates of the next destination, overcoming the problem of producing, in output, a limited set of locations, seen during the training phase. The proposed approach was tested on the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2015 dataset-based on the city of Porto-, obtaining better results with respect to the competition winner, whilst using less information, and on Manhattan and San Francisco datasets."}}

In urban areas, there is greater access to work, a wide variety of options for education and training, ease of transport and the abundance of attractive places within a few kilometers. Across huge cities, people tend to move more and have to do it faster than in the past. On the other hand, heavy traffic (e.g., traffic jams), overbuilding and changes in the urban lifestyle can cause several new problems such as noise, atmospheric pollution (i.e., smog) and severe traffic congestions. However, the rise of novel data sources and machine learning techniques can help to tackle such problems and improve the quality of life of citizens. Indeed, in a smart city environment, the huge amount of data generated daily can be captured by sensors, actuators, and mobile devices. It goes without saying that using such data opens the door to several applications, including forecasting of urban displacements, land use classification and event detection in an urban environment. Motived by these opportunities, Urban Computing (UC) leverages on heterogeneous data sources and applies machine learning techniques to tackle these big challenges that modern cities are facing. In this perspective, one of the core questions when designing UC systems is how to enable models to learn from different urban data sources and thus how to represent urban spaces. The mainstream approach is to represent input objects as feature vectors that encode several aspects of the urban environment such as the presence of people, density of urban activities, and mobility flows. However, this tedious approach of manually feature engineering can be extremely complex, time-consuming and domain-specific dependent. Additionally, it can become even more complex when aggregating multiple geographical data sources such as point-of- interests, administrative boundaries, and mobility data. A valid alternative to feature-based methods is using kernels, which are non-linear functions that map input examples into some high dimensional space allowing for learning more powerful discriminative decision functions. Given a representation of the input object, kernels map it into some high-dimensional space where implicitly a large number of features are generated, allowing for learning robust discriminative functions. In this way the effort for the feature engineering pro- cess can be greatly reduced. Machine Learning Methods for Urban Computing Kernel methods have been widely applied in Natural Language Processing on tasks such as question answering, semantic role labeling and even for solving linguistic games. Taking inspiration from these successful cases, in this thesis we adapt kernel learning for solving novel tasks in UC. First, we focus on the problem of aggregating multiple urban data sources to provide datasets that fuse knowledge from a wide variety of data sources. Next, we focus on the problem of designing an input structure that is representative of urban space. In particular, we propose to model urban areas with tree structures that are fed to tree kernel functions for automatically generate expressive features. We propose several urban space representations that demonstrated to be very effecting in solving novel urban computing tasks such as land use classification and next location prediction in human mobility. Then, by applying a mining algorithm we enabled the interpretation of urban zones, providing help in the difficult problem of understanding the high-level urban characteristics of a city. In fact, our mined substructures provide help in identifying the different urban nature of cities. Finally, we explore the application of machine learning models to novel urban data sources by solving solve innovative tasks such as predicting the future presence of influenza-like symptoms looking at the people\u2019s mobility behaviors."}}
