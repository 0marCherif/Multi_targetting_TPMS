As this task requires tedious manual effort by designers, prior works have attempted to automate this process using generative models, but commonly fell short of providing intuitive user controls and achieving design objectives. In this paper, we build a conditional latent diffusion model, PLay, that generates parametrically conditioned layouts in vector graphic space from user-specified guidelines, which are commonly used by designers for representing their design intents in current practices. Our method outperforms prior works across three datasets on metrics including FID and FD-VG, and in user study. Moreover, it brings a novel and interactive experience to professional layout design processes."}}

While experts rely on tacit knowledge to apply debugging strategies, non-experts lack the experience required to interpret model output and correct Deep Learning (DL) programs. In this work, we identify DL debugging heuristics and strategies used by experts, andIn this work, we categorize the types of errors novices run into when writing ML code, and map them onto opportunities where tools could help. We use them to guide the design of Umlaut. Umlaut\u00a0checks DL program structure and model behavior against these heuristics; provides human-readable error messages to users; and annotates erroneous model output to facilitate error correction. Umlaut\u00a0links code, model output, and tutorial-driven error messages in a single interface. We evaluated Umlaut\u00a0in a study with 15 participants to determine its effectiveness in helping developers find and fix errors in their DL programs. Participants using Umlaut\u00a0found and fixed significantly more bugs and were able to implement fixes for more bugs compared to a baseline condition."}}

Translating these high-level design goals into concrete design mock-ups, however, requires extensive effort and UI design expertise. To facilitate this process for app designers and developers, we introduce three deep-learning techniques to create low-fidelity UI mock-ups from a natural language phrase that describes the high-level design goal (e.g. \"pop up displaying an image and other options\"). In particular, we contribute two retrieval-based methods and one generative method, as well as pre-processing and post-processing techniques to ensure the quality of the created UI mock-ups. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare and contrast each method's ability in suggesting coherent, diverse and relevant UI design mock-ups. We further evaluate these methods with 15 professional UI designers and practitioners to understand each method's advantages and disadvantages. The designers responded positively to the potential of these methods for assisting the design process."}}

Recent developments in deep-learning models drastically improved machines' ability in understanding and generating visual content. An exciting area of development explores deep-learning approaches used to model human sketches, opening opportunities for creative applications. This chapter describes three fundamental steps in developing deep-learning-driven creativity support tools that consumes and generates sketches: 1) a data collection effort that generated a new paired dataset between sketches and mobile user interfaces; 2) a sketch-based user interface retrieval system adapted from state-of-the-art computer vision techniques; and, 3) a conversational sketching system that supports the novel interaction of a natural-language-based sketch/critique authoring process. In this chapter, we survey relevant prior work in both the deep-learning and human-computer-interaction communities, document the data collection process and the systems' architectures in detail, present qualitative and quantitative results, and paint the landscape of several future research directions in this exciting area."}}

We introduce SCRAM, a tool which uses heuristics to detect potential error conditions in model output and suggests actionable steps and best practices to help such users tune their models. Inspired by metaphors from software engineering, SCRAM extends high-level deep learning development tools to interpret model metrics during training and produce human-readable error messages. We validate SCRAM through three author-created example scenarios with image and text datasets, and by collecting informal feedback from ML researchers with teaching experience. We finally reflect upon our feedback for the design of future ML debugging tools."}}

Unfortunately, finding relevant user interface examples, especially in large-scale datasets, is a highly challenging task because user interfaces have aesthetic and functional properties that are only indirectly reflected by their corresponding pixel data and meta-data. This paper introduces Swire, a sketch-based neural-network-driven technique for retrieving user interfaces. We collect the first large-scale user interface sketch dataset from the development of Swire that researchers can use to develop new sketch-based data-driven design interfaces and applications. Swire achieves high performance for querying user interfaces: for a known validation task it retrieves the most relevant example as within the top-10 results for over 60% of queries. With this technique, for the first time designers can accurately retrieve relevant user interface examples with free-form sketches natural to their design workflows. We demonstrate several novel applications driven by Swire that could greatly augment the user interface design process."}}
