The problem is challenging not only in terms of solving the NP-hard inverse problem of reconstructing unknown brain activity across thousands of voxels from a limited number of sensors, but also for the need to simultaneously estimate the noise and interference. We present a generative model with an augmented leadfield matrix to simultaneously estimate brain source activity and sensor noise statistics in electromagnetic brain imaging (EBI). We then derive three Bayesian inference algorithms for this generative model (expectation-maximization (EBI-EM), convex bounding (EBI-Convex) and fixed-point (EBI-Mackay)) to simultaneously estimate the hyperparameters of the prior distribution for brain source activity and sensor noise. A comprehensive performance evaluation for these three algorithms is performed. Simulations consistently show that the performance of EBI-Convex and EBI-Mackay updates is superior to that of EBI-EM. In contrast to the EBI-EM algorithm, both EBI-Convex and EBI-Mackay updates are quite robust to initialization, and are computationally efficient with fast convergence in the presence of both Gaussian and real brain noise. We also demonstrate that EBI-Convex and EBI-Mackay update algorithms can reconstruct complex brain activity with only a few trials of sensor data, and for resting-state data, achieving significant improvement in source reconstruction and noise learning for electromagnetic brain imaging."}}

As complex ML models (e.g., deep neural networks) are often considered black boxes, a wealth of procedures has been developed to shed light on their inner workings and the ways in which their predictions come about, defining the field of \u2018explainable AI\u2019 (XAI). Saliency methods rank input features according to some measure of \u2018importance\u2019. Such methods are difficult to validate since a formal definition of feature importance is, thus far, lacking. It has been demonstrated that some saliency methods can highlight features that have no statistical association with the prediction target (suppressor variables). To avoid misinterpretations due to such behavior, we propose the actual presence of such an association as a necessary condition and objective preliminary definition for feature importance. We carefully crafted a ground-truth dataset in which all statistical dependencies are well-defined and linear, serving as a benchmark to study the problem of suppressor variables. We evaluate common explanation methods including LRP, DTD, PatternNet, PatternAttribution, LIME, Anchors, SHAP, and permutation-based methods with respect to our objective definition. We show that most of these methods are unable to distinguish important features from suppressors in this setting."}}

To evaluate the quality of heatmaps generated by various saliency methods, we developed a framework to generate artificial data with synthetic lesions and a known ground truth map. Using this framework, we evaluated two data sets with different backgrounds, Perlin noise and 2D brain MRI slices, and found that the heatmaps vary strongly between saliency methods and backgrounds. We strongly encourage further evaluation of saliency maps and xAI methods using this framework before applying these in clinical or other safety-critical settings."}}
