However, the short interaction sequences limit the performance of existing SR. To solve this problem, we focus on Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) in this paper, which aims to leverage information from other domains to improve the sequential recommendation performance of a single domain. Solving CDSR is challenging. On the one hand, how to retain single domain preferences as well as integrate cross-domain influence remains an essential problem. On the other hand, the data sparsity problem cannot be totally solved by simply utilizing knowledge from other domains, due to the limited length of the merged sequences. To address the challenges, we propose DDGHM, a novel framework for the CDSR problem, which includes two main modules, i.e., dual dynamic graph modeling and hybrid metric training. The former captures intra-domain and inter-domain sequential transitions through dynamically constructing two-level graphs, i.e., the local graphs and the global graph, and incorporating them with a fuse attentive gating mechanism. The latter enhances user and item representations by employing hybrid metric learning, including collaborative metric for achieving alignment and contrastive metric for preserving uniformity, to further alleviate data sparsity issue and improve prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of DDHMG."}}

However, existing solutions neglect to model two inherent properties of sequential representing distributions, i.e., hierarchy structures resulted from item popularity and collaborations existing in both intra- and inter-session. Tackling with these two factors at the same time is challenging. On the one hand, traditional Euclidean space utilized in previous studies fails to capture hierarchy structures due to a restricted representation ability. On the other hand, the intuitive apply of hyperbolic geometry could extract hierarchical patterns but more emphasis on degree distribution weakens intra- and inter-session collaborations. To address the challenges, we propose a Hierarchy-Aware Dual Clustering Graph Network (HADCG) model for session-based recommendation. Towards the first challenge, we design the hierarchy-aware graph modeling module which converts sessions into hyperbolic session graphs, adopting hyperbolic geometry in propagation and attention mechanism so as to integrate chronological and hierarchical information. As for the second challenge, we introduce the deep dual clustering module which develops a two-level clustering strategy, i.e., information regularizer for intra-session clustering and contrastive learner for inter-session clustering, to enhance hyperbolic representation learning from collaborative perspectives and further promote recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HADCG."}}

This commonly exist problem is rather challenging from two perspectives, i.e., the implicit user historical rating sequences are difficult in modeling and the users/items on different domains are mostly non-overlapped. Most previous sequential CDR approaches cannot solve the cross-domain sequential recommendation problem well, since (1) they cannot sufficiently depict the users\u2019 actual preferences, (2) they cannot leverage and transfer useful knowledge across domains. To tackle the above issues, we propose joint Internal multi-interest exploration and External domain alignment for cross domain Sequential Recommendation model (IESRec). IESRec\u00a0includes two main modules, i.e., internal multi-interest exploration module and external domain alignment module. To reflect the users\u2019 diverse characteristics with multi-interests evolution, we first propose internal temporal optimal transport method in the internal multi-interest exploration module.

However, they still suffer from two critical problems: (1) Mini-batch Sampling Effects (MSE), where the alignment easily fails due to the outcome imbalance or outliers in the batch; (2) Unobserved Confounder Effects (UCE), where the unobserved confounders damage the correct alignment. To tackle these problems, we propose a principled approach named Entire Space CounterFactual Regression (ESCFR) based on a generalized sinkhorn discrepancy for distribution alignment within the stochastic optimal transport framework. Based on the framework, we propose a relaxed mass preserving regularizer to address the MSE issue and design a proximal factual outcome regularizer to handle the UCE issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ESCFR can successfully tackle the treatment selection bias and achieve significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods."}}

Most of the existing CDR models assume that both the source and target domains share the same overlapped user set for knowledge transfer. However, only few proportion of users simultaneously activate on both the source and target domains in practical CDR tasks. In this paper, we focus on the Partially Overlapped Cross-Domain Recommendation (POCDR) problem, that is, how to leverage the information of both the overlapped and non-overlapped users to improve recommendation performance. Existing approaches cannot fully utilize the useful knowledge behind the non-overlapped users across domains, which limits the model performance when the majority of users turn out to be non-overlapped. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Dual-autoencoder with Variational Domain-invariant Embedding Alignment (VDEA) model, a cross-domain recommendation framework for the POCDR problem, which utilizes dual variational autoencoders with both local and global embedding alignment for exploiting domain-invariant user embedding. VDEA first adopts variational inference to capture collaborative user preferences, and then utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distribution co-clustering optimal transport to cluster the users with similar rating interaction behaviors. Our empirical studies on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate that VDEA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, especially under the POCDR setting."}}

Although meta-learning is widely adopted to address the data sparsity problem in general domains, directly applying it to healthcare data is less effective, since it is unclear how to capture both the temporal relations in clinical visits and the complicated relations among syndromic diseases for precise personalized diagnosis. To this end, we first propose a novel Meta-learning framework for cold-start diagnosis prediction in healthCare data (MetaCare). By explicitly encoding the effects of disease progress over time as a generalization prior, MetaCare dynamically predicts future diagnosis and timestamp for infrequent patients. Then, to model complicated relations among rare diseases, we propose to utilize domain knowledge of hierarchical relations among diseases, and further perform diagnosis subtyping to mine the latent syndromic relations among diseases. Finally, to tailor the generic meta-learning framework with personalized parameters, we design a hierarchical patient subtyping mechanism and bridge the modeling of both infrequent patients and rare diseases. We term the joint model as MetaCare++. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets show significant performance gains brought by MetaCare++, yielding average improvements of 7.71% for diagnosis prediction and 13.94% for diagnosis time prediction over the state-of-the-art baselines."}}

In this paper, we focus on the Review-based Non-overlapped Recommendation (RNCDR) problem. The problem is commonly-existed and challenging due to two main aspects, i.e, there are only positive user-item ratings on the target domain and there is no overlapped user across different domains. Most previous CDR approaches cannot solve the RNCDR problem well, since (1) they cannot effectively combine review with other information (e.g., ID or ratings) to obtain expressive user or item embedding, (2) they cannot reduce the domain discrepancy on users and items. To fill this gap, we propose Collaborative Filtering with Attribution Alignment model (CFAA), a cross-domain recommendation framework for the RNCDR problem. CFAA\u00a0includes two main modules, i.e., rating prediction module and embedding attribution alignment module. The former aims to jointly mine review, one-hot ID, and multi-hot historical ratings to generate expressive user and item embeddings.

Recently, hash-based collaborative filtering (Hash-CF) approaches employ efficient Hamming distance of learned binary representations of users and items to accelerate recommendations. However, Hash-CF often faces two challenging problems, i.e., optimization on discrete representations and preserving semantic information in learned representations. To address the above two challenges, we propose HCFRec, a novel Hash-CF approach for effective and efficient recommendations. Specifically, HCFRec not only innovatively introduces normalized flow to learn the optimal hash code by efficiently fitting a proposed approximate mixture multivariate normal distribution, a continuous but approximately discrete distribution, but also deploys a cluster consistency preserving mechanism to preserve the semantic structure in representations for more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our HCFRec compared to the state-of-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."}}
