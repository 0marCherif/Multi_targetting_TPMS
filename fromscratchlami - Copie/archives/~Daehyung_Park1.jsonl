However, its fine validation process is often costly due to computationally expensive collision searches, otherwise coarse searches lower the safety of the system losing a precise solution. To resolve the issues, we introduce a new collision-distance estimator, GraphDistNet, that can precisely encode the structural information between two geometries by leveraging edge feature-based convolutional operations, and also efficiently predict a batch of collision distances and gradients through 25,000 random environments with a maximum of 20 unforeseen objects. Further, we show the adoption of attention mechanism enables our method to be easily generalized in unforeseen complex geometries toward TO. Our evaluation show GraphDistNet outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both simulated and real world tasks."}}

Interventions often invalidate the current plan and require replanning on the fly. Replanning can be computationally expensive and often interrupts seamless task execution. We introduce a dynamically reconfigurable planning methodology with behavior tree-based control strategies toward reactive TAMP, which takes the advantage of previous plans and incremental graph search during temporal logic-based reactive synthesis. Our algorithm also shows efficient recovery functionalities that minimize the number of replanning steps. Finally, our algorithm produces a robust, efficient, and complete TAMP solution. Our experimental results show the algorithm results in superior manipulation performance in both simulated and real-world tasks."}}
