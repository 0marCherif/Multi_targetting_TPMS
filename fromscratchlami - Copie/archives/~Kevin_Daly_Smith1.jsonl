This paper considers the estimation problem of predicting unlabeled edge flows from nodal supply and demand. We propose an implicit neural network layer that incorporates two fundamental physical laws: conservation of mass, and the existence of a constitutive relationship between edge flows and nodal states (e.g., Ohm's law). Computing the edge flows from these two laws is a nonlinear inverse problem, which our layer solves efficiently with a specialized contraction mapping. Using implicit differentiation to compute the solution's gradients, our model is able to learn the constitutive relationship within a semi-supervised framework. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately predict edge flows in several experiments on AC power networks and water distribution systems."}}
