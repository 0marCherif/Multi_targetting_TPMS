It allows to transfer the style of the font image in a source domain to the style defined with a few reference images in a target domain. However, the content feature extracted using a representative font might not be optimal. In light of this, we propose a content fusion module (CFM) to project the content feature into a linear space defined by the content features of basis fonts, which can take the variation of content features caused by different fonts into consideration. Our method also allows to optimize the style representation vector of reference images through a lightweight iterative style-vector refinement (ISR) strategy. Moreover, we treat the 1D projection of a character image as a probability distribution and leverage the distance between two distributions as the reconstruction loss (namely projected character loss, PCL). Compared to L2 or L1 reconstruction loss, the distribution distance pays more attention to the global shape of characters. We have evaluated our method on a dataset of 300 fonts with 6.5k characters each. Experimental results verify that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot font generation methods by a large margin."}}

Recently, applying deep learning models to generate layouts has attracted increasing attention. This paper focuses on using the GAN-based model conditioned on image contents to generate advertising poster graphic layouts, which requires an advertising poster layout dataset with paired product images and graphic layouts. However, the paired images and layouts in the existing dataset are collected by inpainting and annotating posters, respectively. There exists a domain gap between inpainted posters (source domain data) and clean product images (target domain data). Therefore, this paper combines unsupervised domain adaption techniques to design a GAN with a novel pixel-level discriminator (PD), called PDA-GAN, to generate graphic layouts according to image contents. The PD is connected to the shallow level feature map and computes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PDA-GAN can achieve state-of-the-art performances and generate high-quality image-aware graphic layouts for advertising posters."}}

In a sparse (e.g., 3 RGBD sensors) capture setting, the depth noise is typically amplified in the PIFu representation, resulting in flat facial surfaces and geometry-fallible bodies. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-aware two-scale PIFu for 3D human reconstruction from sparse, noisy inputs. Our key idea is to exploit the complementary properties of depth denoising and 3D reconstruction, for learning a two-scale PIFu representation to reconstruct high-frequency facial details and consistent bodies separately. To this end, we first formulate depth denoising and 3D reconstruction as a multi-task learning problem. The depth denoising process enriches the local geometry information of the reconstruction features, while the reconstruction process enhances depth denoising with global topology information. We then propose to learn the two-scale PIFu representation using two MLPs based on the denoised depth and geometry-aware features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reconstructing facial details and bodies of different poses and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods."}}

Such problems can be challenging because of imperfect data (noise, outliers and partial overlap) and high degrees of freedom. Existing methods typically adopt the $\\ell_{p}$ type robust norm to measure the alignment error and regularize the smoothness of deformation, and use a proximal algorithm to solve the resulting non-smooth optimization problem. However, the slow convergence of such algorithms limits their wide applications. In this paper, we propose a formulation for robust non-rigid registration based on a globally smooth robust norm for alignment and regularization, which can effectively handle outliers and partial overlaps. The problem is solved using the majorization-minimization algorithm, which reduces each iteration to a convex quadratic problem with a closed-form solution. We further apply Anderson acceleration to speed up the convergence of the solver, enabling the solver to run efficiently on devices with limited compute capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for non-rigid alignment between two shapes with outliers and partial overlaps, with quantitative evaluation showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of registration accuracy and computational speed.

It combines the advantage of explicit mesh and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network, a hybrid representation, to simplify the capture setting used in recent contributions. After obtaining an initial shape through the multi-view silhouettes, we introduce surface-based local MLPs to encode the vertex displacement field (VDF) for the reconstruction of surface details. The design of local MLPs allows to represent the VDF in a piece-wise manner using two layer MLP networks, which is beneficial to the optimization algorithm. Defining local MLPs on the surface instead of the volume also reduces the searching space. Such a hybrid representation enables us to relax the ray-pixel correspondences that represent the light path constraint to our designed ray-cell correspondences, which significantly simplifies the implementation of single-image based environment matting algorithm. We evaluate our representation and reconstruction algorithm on several transparent objects with ground truth models. Our experiments show that our method can produce high-quality reconstruction results superior to state-of-the-art methods using a simplified data acquisition setup."}}

However, identifying a quantization scheme that meets the requirement of both precision and memory efficiency requires trial and error. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to allow users to obtain a quantization scheme by simply specifying either an error bound or a memory compression rate. Based on the error propagation theory, our method takes advantage of auto-diff to estimate the contributions of each quantization operation to the total error. We formulate the task as a constrained optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved with analytical formulas derived for the linearized objective function. Our workflow extends the Taichi compiler and introduces dithering to improve the precision of quantized simulations. We demonstrate the generality and efficiency of our method via several challenging examples of physics-based simulation, which achieves up to 2.5\u00d7 memory compression without noticeable degradation of visual quality in the results.

Our method is inspired by Bayesian deep learning which improves image segmentation accuracy by modeling the uncertainty of the network output. In contrast to uncertainty, our method directly learns to predict the erroneous pixels of a segmentation network, which is modeled as a binary classification problem. It can speed up training comparing to the Monte Carlo integration often used in Bayesian deep learning. It also allows us to train a branch to correct the labels of erroneous pixels. Our method consists of three stages: (i) predict pixel-wise error probability of the initial result, (ii) redetermine new labels for pixels with high error probability, and (iii) fuse the initial result and the redetermined result with respect to the error probability. We formulate the error-pixel prediction problem as a classification task and employ an error-prediction branch in the network to predict pixel-wise error probabilities. We also introduce a detail branch to focus the training process on the erroneous pixels. We have experimentally validated our method on the Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets. Our model can be easily added to various advanced segmentation networks to improve their performance. Taking DeepLabv3+ as an example, our network can achieve 82.88% of mIoU on Cityscapes testing dataset and 45.73% on ADE20K validation dataset, improving corresponding DeepLabv3+ results by 0.74% and 0.13% respectively."}}

Based on the predicted boundaries detected from the segmentation results using current network parameters, we formulate the boundary alignment problem as a differentiable direction vector prediction problem to guide the movement of predicted boundaries in each iteration. Our loss is model-agnostic and can be plugged in to the training of segmentation networks to improve the boundary details. Experimental results show that training with the active boundary loss can effectively improve the boundary F-score and mean Intersection-over-Union on challenging image and video object segmentation datasets."}}
