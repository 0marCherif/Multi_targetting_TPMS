To advance the field, it is crucial to generate large-scale datasets. Compositional RL is particularly appealing for generating such large datasets, since 1) it permits creating many tasks from few components, and 2) the task structure may enable trained agents to solve new tasks by combining relevant learned components. This paper provides four offline RL datasets for simulated robotic manipulation created using the 256 tasks from CompoSuite. Each dataset is collected from an agent with a different degree of performance, and consists of 256 million transitions. We provide training and evaluation settings for assessing an agent\u2019s ability to learn compositional task policies. Our benchmarking experiments on each setting show that current offline RL methods can learn the training tasks to some extent, but are unable to extract their compositional structure to generalize to unseen tasks, showing a need for further research in offline compositional RL."}}

However, the state-of-the-art has yet to explicitly address how to reduce the performance gap between using partially labeled data and fully labeled. In response, we propose a general-purpose SSCL framework, namely DP-SSCL, that uses data programming (DP) to pseudo-label the unlabeled data per task, and then cascades both ground-truth-labeled and pseudo-labeled data to update a downstream supervised continual learning model. The framework includes a feedback loop that brings mutual benefits: On one hand, DP-SSCL inherits guaranteed pseudo-labeling quality from DP techniques to improve continual learning, approaching the performance of using fully supervised data. On the other hand, knowledge transfer from previous tasks facilitates training of the DP pseudo-labeler, taking advantage of cumulative information via self-teaching. Experiments show that (1) DP-SSCL bridges the performance gap, approaching the final accuracy and catastrophic forgetting as using fully labeled data, (2) DP-SSCL outperforms existing SSCL approaches at low cost, by up to $25\\%$ higher final accuracy and lower catastrophic forgetting on standard benchmarks, while reducing memory overhead from $100$ MB level to $1$ MB level at the same time complexity, and (3) DP-SSCL is flexible, maintaining steady performance supporting plug-and-play extensions for a variety of supervised continual learning models."}}

Nevertheless, an issue that has been rarely addressed is the lack of labels at the individual task level. The state-of-the-art of LML largely addresses supervised learning, with a few semi-supervised continual learning exceptions which require training additional models, which in turn impose constraints on the LML methods themselves. Therefore, we propose Mako, a wrapper tool that mounts on top of supervised LML frameworks, leveraging data programming. Mako imposes no additional knowledge base overhead and enables continual semi-supervised learning with a limited amount of labeled data. This tool achieves similar performance, in terms of per-task accuracy and resistance to catastrophic forgetting, as compared to fully labeled data. We ran extensive experiments on LML task sequences created from standard image classification data sets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and the results show that after utilizing Mako to leverage unlabeled data, LML tools are able to achieve $97\\%$ performance of supervised learning on fully labeled data in terms of accuracy and catastrophic forgetting prevention. Moreover, when compared to baseline semi-supervised LML tools such as CNNL, ORDisCo and DistillMatch, Mako significantly outperforms them, increasing accuracy by $0.25$ on certain benchmarks."}}

This type of compositional reasoning permits reuse of the subproblem solutions when tackling future tasks that share part of the underlying compositional structure. In a continual or lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) setting, this ability to decompose knowledge into reusable components would enable agents to quickly learn new RL tasks by leveraging accumulated compositional structures. We explore a particular form of composition based on neural modules and present a set of RL problems that intuitively admit compositional solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate that neural composition indeed captures the underlying structure of this space of problems. We further propose a compositional lifelong RL method that leverages accumulated neural components to accelerate the learning of future tasks while retaining performance on previous tasks via off-line RL over replayed experiences."}}

This EM-based selective transfer is highly effective, as demonstrated on three algorithms in several lifelong object classification scenarios."}}

We integrate these two lines of work to present a general-purpose framework for lifelong learning of compositional structures that can be used for solving a stream of related tasks. Our framework separates the learning process into two broad stages: learning how to best combine existing components in order to assimilate a novel problem, and learning how to adapt the set of existing components to accommodate the new problem.

To formalize this intuition, we define the performance gap as a measure of the discrepancy between the source and target domains. We derive generalization bounds for the instance weighting approach to transfer learning, showing that the performance gap can be viewed as an algorithm-dependent regularizer, which controls the model complexity. Our theoretical analysis provides new insight into transfer learning and motivates a set of general, principled rules for designing new instance weighting schemes for transfer learning. These rules lead to gapBoost, a novel and principled boosting approach for transfer learning. Our experimental evaluation on benchmark data sets shows that gapBoost significantly outperforms previous boosting-based transfer learning algorithms.\n"}}

Their biggest downside is the amount of exploration they require before yielding high-performing policies. In a lifelong learning setting, in which an agent is faced with multiple consecutive tasks over its lifetime, reusing information from previously seen tasks can substantially accelerate the learning of new tasks. We provide a novel method for lifelong policy gradient learning that trains lifelong function approximators directly via policy gradients, allowing the agent to benefit from accumulated knowledge throughout the entire training process. We show empirically that our algorithm learns faster and converges to better policies than single-task and lifelong learning baselines, and completely avoids catastrophic forgetting on a variety of challenging domains."}}
