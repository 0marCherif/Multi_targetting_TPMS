The dataset contains more than 340,000 keywords, totaling 23.4 million 1-second spoken examples (over 6,000 hours). The dataset has many use cases, ranging from voice-enabled consumer devices to call center automation. We generate this dataset by applying forced alignment on crowd-sourced sentence-level audio to produce per-word timing estimates for extraction. All alignments are included in the dataset. We provide a detailed analysis of the contents of the data and contribute methods for detecting potential outliers. We report baseline accuracy metrics on keyword spotting models trained from our dataset compared to models trained on a manually-recorded keyword dataset. We conclude with our plans for dataset maintenance, updates, and open-sourced code."}}
