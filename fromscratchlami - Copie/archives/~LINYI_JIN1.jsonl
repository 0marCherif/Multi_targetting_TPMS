While seemingly easy for humans, this problem poses many challenges for computers. Our approach is based on a top-down detection system that finds planes that can be articulated. This approach is followed by optimizing for a 3D plane that explains a sequence of detected articulations. We show that this system can be trained on a combination of videos and 3D scan datasets. When tested on a dataset of challenging Internet videos and the Charades dataset, our approach obtains strong performance."}}

This reconstruction task is challenging since it requires jointly reasoning about single image 3D reconstruction, correspondence between images, and the relative camera pose between images. Past work has proposed optimization-based approaches. We introduce a simpler approach, the PlaneFormer, that uses a transformer applied to 3D-aware plane tokens to perform 3D reasoning. Our experiments show that our approach is substantially more effective than prior work, and that several 3D-specific design decisions are crucial for its success."}}

While prior approaches have successfully created object-centric reconstructions of many scenes, they fail to exploit other structures, such as planes, which are typically the dominant components of indoor scenes. In this paper, we re-construct planar surfaces from multiple views, while jointly estimating camera pose. Our experiments demonstrate that our method is able to advance the state of the art of re-construction from sparse views, on challenging scenes from Matterport3D."}}

While seemingly easy for humans, this problem poses many challenges for computers since it requires simultaneously reconstructing objects in the two views while also figuring out their relationship. We propose a new approach that estimates reconstructions, distributions over the camera/object and camera/camera transformations, as well as an inter-view object affinity matrix. This information is then jointly reasoned over to produce the most likely explanation of the scene. We train and test our approach on a dataset of indoor scenes, and rigorously evaluate the merits of our joint reasoning approach. Our experiments show that it is able to recover reasonable scenes from sparse views, while the problem is still challenging. Project site: https://jasonqsy.github.io/Associative3D ."}}

However, cluttered environments entail that objects often occlude one another, making it difficult to segment objects and infer their shapes and properties. Instead of relying on the availability of CAD or other explicit models of scene objects, we augment a manipulation planner for cluttered environments with a state-of-the-art deep neural network for shape completion as well as a volumetric memory system, allowing the robot to reason about what may be contained in occluded areas. We test the system in a variety of tabletop manipulation scenes composed of household items, highlighting its applicability to realistic domains. Our results suggest that incorporating both components into a manipulation planning framework significantly reduces the number of actions needed to find a hidden object in dense clutter."}}
