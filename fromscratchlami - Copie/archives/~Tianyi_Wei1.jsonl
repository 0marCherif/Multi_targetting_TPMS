Early hair editing methods use well-drawn sketches or masks to specify the editing conditions. Even though they can enable very fine-grained local control, such interaction modes are inefficient for the editing conditions that can be easily specified by language descriptions or reference images. Thanks to the recent breakthrough of cross-modal models (e.g., CLIP), HairCLIP is the first work that enables hair editing based on text descriptions or reference images. However, such text-driven and reference-driven interaction modes make HairCLIP unable to support fine-grained controls specified by sketch or mask. In this paper, we propose HairCLIPv2, aiming to support all the aforementioned interactions with one unified framework. Simultaneously, it improves upon HairCLIP with better irrelevant attributes (e.g., identity, background) preservation and unseen text descriptions support. The key idea is to convert all the hair editing tasks into hair transfer tasks, with editing conditions converted into different proxies accordingly. The editing effects are added upon the input image by blending the corresponding proxy features within the hairstyle or hair color feature spaces. Besides the unprecedented user interaction mode support, quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of HairCLIPv2 in terms of editing effects, irrelevant attribute preservation and visual naturalness.

The goal of StyleGAN inversion is to find the exact latent code of the given image in the latent space of StyleGAN. This problem has a high demand for quality and efficiency. Existing optimization-based methods can produce high-quality results, but the optimization often takes a long time. On the contrary, forward-based methods are usually faster but the quality of their results is inferior. In this paper, we present a new feed-forward network \u201cE2Style\u201d for StyleGAN inversion, with significant improvement in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. In our inversion network, we introduce: 1) a shallower backbone with multiple efficient heads across scales; 2) multi-layer identity loss and multi-layer face parsing loss to the loss function; and 3) multi-stage refinement. Combining these designs together forms an effective and efficient method that exploits all benefits of optimization-based and forward-based methods. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our E2Style performs better than existing forward-based methods and comparably to state-of-the-art optimization-based methods while maintaining the high efficiency as well as forward-based methods. Moreover, a number of real image editing applications demonstrate the efficacy of our E2Style.

Many existing methods require well-drawn sketches or masks as conditional inputs for editing, however these interactions are neither straight-forward nor efficient. In order to free users from the tedious interaction process, this paper proposes a new hair editing interaction mode, which enables manipulating hair attributes individually or jointly based on the texts or reference images provided by users. For this purpose, we encode the image and text conditions in a shared embedding space and propose a unified hair editing framework by leveraging the powerful image text representation capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model. With the carefully designed network structures and loss functions, our framework can perform high-quality hair editing in a disentangled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of manipulation accuracy, visual realism of editing results, and irrelevant attribute preservation."}}

Most existing matting methods leverage a user-supplied trimap as an auxiliary input to produce good alpha matte. However, obtaining high-quality trimap itself is arduous, thus restricting the application of these methods. Recently, some trimap-free methods have emerged, however, the matting quality is still far behind the trimap-based methods. The main reason is that, without the trimap guidance in some cases, the target network is ambiguous about which is the foreground target. In fact, choosing the foreground is a subjective procedure and depends on the user's intention. To this end, this paper proposes an improved deep image matting framework which is trimap-free and only needs several user click interactions to eliminate the ambiguity. Moreover, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation module that can predict which parts need polishing and a following local refinement module. Based on the computation budget, users can choose how many local parts to improve with the uncertainty guidance. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method performs better than existing trimap-free methods and comparably to state-of-the-art trimap-based methods with minimal user effort."}}

Recently, how to detect such forgery contents has become a hot research topic and many deepfake detection methods have been proposed. Most of them model deepfake detection as a vanilla binary classification problem, i.e, first use a backbone network to extract a global feature and then feed it into a binary classifier (real/fake). But since the difference between the real and fake images in this task is often subtle and local, we argue this vanilla solution is not optimal. In this paper, we instead formulate deepfake detection as a fine-grained classification problem and propose a new multi-attentional deepfake detection network. Specifically, it consists of three key components: 1) multiple spatial attention heads to make the network attend to different local parts; 2) textural feature enhancement block to zoom in the subtle artifacts in shallow features; 3) aggregate the low-level textural feature and high-level semantic features guided by the attention maps. Moreover, to address the learning difficulty of this network, we further introduce a new regional independence loss and an attention guided data augmentation strategy. Through extensive experiments on different datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over the vanilla binary classifier counterparts, and achieve state-of-the-art performance."}}
