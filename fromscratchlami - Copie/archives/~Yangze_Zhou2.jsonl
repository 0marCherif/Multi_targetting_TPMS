On the one hand, we can find the treatment with the best effect through uplift modeling. On the other hand, we can find customers who tend to make corresponding positive decisions in a given treatment. The past uplift modeling methods are mostly based on the difference-in-difference(DID) framework, combined with the machine learning model as the learner to make an estimation, ignoring the relationship and confidential information among features in uplift modeling. We propose a graph neural network-based framework combining causal knowledge as an estimator of uplift value. Firstly, we proposed a causal representation method based on conditional average treatment effect(CATE) estimation and adjacency matrix structure learning. Secondly, we proposed an uplift modeling framework based on graph convolution networks to combine the causal knowledge, which has better scalability. Our experimental results show that our method can estimate the uplift value with minor errors in the general simulation data, and its performance has also been verified in the actual industry marketing data."}}
