Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that TrIVD achieves state-of-the-art performances across all image/video OD and MOT tasks."}}

To this end, we first investigate the generalization properties of classic image generators, and discover that autoencoders generalize extremely well to new domains, even when trained on highly constrained data. We leverage this insight to produce a robust, unsupervised few-shot image generation algorithm, and introduce a novel training procedure based on recovering an image from data augmentations. Our Augmentation-Interpolative AutoEncoders synthesize realistic images of novel objects from only a few reference images, and outperform both prior interpolative models and supervised few-shot image generators. Our procedure is simple and lightweight, generalizes broadly, and requires no category labels or other supervision during training."}}

While deep neural networks have achieved impressive results on point cloud learning tasks, they require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming to collect. In this paper, we leverage 3D self-supervision for learning downstream tasks on point clouds with fewer labels. A point cloud can be rotated in infinitely many ways, which provides a rich label-free source for self-supervision. We consider the auxiliary task of predicting rotations that in turn leads to useful features for other tasks such as shape classification and 3D keypoint prediction. Using experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. Moreover, features learned by our model are complementary to other self-supervised methods and combining them leads to further performance improvement."}}

Our method is designed to learn from a traditionally animated sequence, where each frame is drawn by an artist, and thus the input images lack any common structure, correspondences, or labels. We express pose changes as a deformation of a layered 2.5D template mesh, and devise a novel architecture that learns to predict mesh deformations matching the template to a target image. This enables us to extract a common low-dimensional structure from a diverse set of character poses. We combine recent advances in differentiable rendering as well as mesh-aware models to successfully align common template even if only a few character images are available during training. In addition to coarse poses, character appearance also varies due to shading, out-of-plane motions, and artistic effects. We capture these subtle changes by applying an image translation network to refine the mesh rendering, providing an end-to-end model to generate new animations of a character with high visual quality. We demonstrate that our generative model can be used to synthesize in-between frames and to create data-driven deformation. Our template fitting procedure outperforms state-of-the-art generic techniques for detecting image correspondences."}}

We make these two representations synergistic by introducing novel consistency losses that ensure that the surface created from the atlas aligns with the level-set of the implicit function. Our hybrid architecture outputs results which are superior to the output of the two equivalent single-representation networks, yielding smoother explicit surfaces with more accurate normals, and a more accurate implicit occupancy function. Additionally, our surface reconstruction step can directly leverage the explicit atlas-based representation. This process is computationally efficient, and can be directly used by differentiable rasterizers, enabling training our hybrid representation with image-based losses."}}
