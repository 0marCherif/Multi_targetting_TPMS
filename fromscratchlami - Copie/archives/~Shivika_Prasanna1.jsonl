In this demo paper, we present a document retrieval system that allows users to search for a keyword in digitized copies of physical records. The system uses cleaned and denoised images to search a keyword using optical char- acter recognition (OCR) models re-trained on labeled data provided by experts. The word predictions and bounding boxes are stored as a knowledge graph (KG). A keyword query is then mapped to a graph query on the KG. The results are ranked based on text matching. An intuitive user interface (UI) allows a user to search, correct, delete or draw more annotations that are used for retraining of the OCR models."}}

Manuscripts written in cursive are even more difficult due to overlapping words with random spacing, irregular and varying characters' shapes, poor scan quality, and insufficient labeled data. Despite the significant achievements of deep learning approaches in computer vision, handwritten word recognition is far from solved. Most of the existing methods focus on well-segmented word datasets. In this paper, we present an empirical study investigating how well state-of-the-art deep learning models perform on detection and recognition of handwritten words in Spanish American notary records. Professional historians were involved in preparing a labeled dataset of 26,482 Spanish words employed in the experiments. We investigate the performance of some state-of-the-art models on optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten text documents: Keras-OCR, the object detection algorithm \"You Only Look Once\" (YOLO), Tesseract OCR, Kraken, and Calamari-OCR. Since YOLO does not include a text recognizer, we propose YOLO-OCR, an innovative model to detect and recognize words in historical manuscripts written in Spanish. Our results show the performance of pre-trained models on our dataset and that Keras-OCR and YOLO-OCR models are highly valuable for content extraction."}}

While the negative impact of the pandemic on mankind is unimaginable, this pandemic has triggered new research and innovation in the use of artificial intelligence for developing solutions to better understand and mitigate the pandemic. Several valuable datasets have been made available by different organizations and research groups. In this chapter, we provide an overview of real-world COVID-19 data sources available for developing novel applications and solutions for the pandemic. We provide a comparison between them from a data science perspective. Next, we delve deep into the Cerner Real-World Data for COVID-19. We discuss the schema of the database, data quality issues, data wrangling using Apache Spark, and data analysis using popular machine learning techniques. Specifically, we provide examples of querying the database, training machine learning models, and visualization. We also discuss the technical challenges that we encountered and how we overcame them to complete multiple clinical studies on COVID-19."}}

In this paper, we explore if deepfakes can be generated for histopathology images using advances in deep learning. This is because the field of digital pathology is gaining a lot of momentum since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a few digital pathology systems for primary diagnosis and consultation in the United States. Specifically, we investigate if state-of-the- art generative adversarial networks (GANs) can produce fake histopathology images that can trick an expert pathologist. For our investigation, we used whole slide images (WSIs) hosted by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We selected 3 WSIs of colon cancer patients and produced 100,000 patches of 256\u00d7256 pixels in size. We trained three popular GANs to generate fake patches of the same size. We then constructed a set of images containing 30 real and 30 fake patches. An expert pathologist reviewed these images and marked them as either real or fake. We observed that the pathologist marked 10 fake patches as real and correctly identified 34 patches (as fake or real). Thirteen patches were incorrectly identified as fake. The pathologist was unsure of 3 fake patches. Interestingly, the fake patches that were correctly identified by the pathologist, had missing morphological features, abrupt background change, pleomorphism, and other incorrect artifacts. Our investigation shows that while certain parts of a histopathology image can be mimicked by existing GANs, the intricacies of the stained tissue and cells cannot be fully captured by them. Unlike radiology, where it is relatively easier to manipulate an image using a GAN, we argue that it is a harder challenge in digital pathology to generate an entire WSI that is fake."}}
