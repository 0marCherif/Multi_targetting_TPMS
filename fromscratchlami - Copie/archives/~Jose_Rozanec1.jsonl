The increasing amount of data available requires new approaches to efficiently ingest and process such data. In this research, we describe a solution at a conceptual level in the context of the Graph-Massivizer architecture. Graph-Inceptor aims to bridge the void among ETL tools enabling data transformations required for graph creation and enrichment and supporting connectors to multiple graph storages at a massive scale. Furthermore, it aims to enhance ETL operations by learning from data content and load and making decisions based on machine-learning-based predictive analytics."}}

Automating Strategic Foresight", "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that strategic foresight is much needed to guide efficient policy-making. The growing digitalization implies a rising amount of digital evidence of many aspects of society (e.g., science, economy, and politics). Artificial intelligence can process massive amounts of data and extract meaningful information. Furthermore, a knowledge graph can be developed to capture significant aspects of reality, and machine learning models can be used to identify patterns and derive insights. This paper describes how we envision artificial intelligence could be used to create and deliver strategic foresight automatically."}}

Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs), as an evolution, utilize services and tools towards enabling human-like cognitive capabilities in DTs. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for implementing CDTs to support resilience in production, i.e., to enable manufacturing systems to identify and handle anomalies and disruptive events in production processes and to support decisions to alleviate their consequences. Through analyzing five real-life production cases in different industries, similarities and differences in their corresponding needs are identified. Moreover, a connection between resilience and cognition is established. Further, a conceptual architecture is proposed that maps the tools materializing cognition within the DT core together with a cognitive process that enables resilience in production by utilizing CDTs."}}

Nevertheless, there is a lack of architecture that considers safety, trustworthiness, and human-centricity at its core. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates Artificial Intelligence (Active Learning, Forecasting, Explainable Artificial Intelligence), simulated reality, decision-making, and users' feedback, focusing on synergies between humans and machines. Furthermore, we align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model. Finally, we validate it on three use cases from real-world case studies."}}

We explore three sets of features and three dataset variations to train machine learning models. Our results show clustering algorithms achieved promising results. In particular, we consider the best results were obtained by applying the DBSCAN algorithm to the structured structural similarity index measure computed between the images and a white reference image."}}

The introduction of artificial intelligence models enables to automate the visual quality inspection, speeding up the inspection process and ensuring all products are evaluated under the same criteria. In this research, we compare supervised and unsupervised defect detection techniques and explore data augmentation techniques to mitigate the data imbalance in the context of automated visual inspection. Furthermore, we use Generative Adversarial Networks for data augmentation to enhance the classifiers' discriminative performance. Our results show that state-of-the-art unsupervised defect detection does not match the performance of supervised models but can be used to reduce the labeling workload by more than 50%. Furthermore, the best classification performance was achieved considering GAN-based data generation with AUC ROC scores equal to or higher than 0,9898, even when increasing the dataset imbalance by leaving only 25\\% of the images denoting defective products. We performed the research with real-world data provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV."}}

Responsible decision making requires accurate forecasts and an understanding of the models\u2019 behavior. Furthermore, the insights into the models\u2019 rationale can be enriched with domain knowledge. This research builds explanations considering feature rankings for a particular forecast, enriching them with media news entries, datasets\u2019 metadata, and entries from the Google knowledge graph. We compare two approaches (embeddings-based and semantic-based) on a real-world use case regarding demand forecasting. The embeddings-based approach measures the similarity between relevant concepts and retrieved media news entries and datasets\u2019 metadata based on the word movers\u2019 distance between embeddings. The semantic-based approach recourses to wikification and measures the Jaccard distance instead. The semantic-based approach leads to more diverse entries when displaying media events and more precise and diverse results regarding recommended datasets. We conclude that the explanations provided can be further improved with information regarding the purpose of potential actions that can be taken to influence demand and to provide \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis capabilities."}}
