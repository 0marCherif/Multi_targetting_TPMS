At the macroscopic scale, neurophysiological experiments have described the corresponding neural signals as both forward and backward-travelling waves, sometimes with characteristic oscillatory signatures. It remains unclear, however, how such activity patterns relate to specific functional properties of the perceptual apparatus. Here, we present a mathematical framework, inspired by neural network models of predictive coding, to systematically investigate neural dynamics in a hierarchical perceptual system. We show that stability of the system can be systematically derived from the values of hyper-parameters controlling the different signals (related to bottom-up inputs, top-down prediction and error correction). Similarly, it is possible to determine in which direction, and at what speed neural activity propagates in the system. Different neural assemblies (reflecting distinct eigenvectors of the connectivity matrices) can simultaneously and independently display different properties in terms of stability, propagation speed or direction. We also derive continuous-limit versions of the system, both in time and in neural space. Finally, we analyze the possible influence of transmission delays between layers, and reveal the emergence of oscillations at biologically plausible frequencies."}}

Previous studies have succeeded in re-creating different aspects of the visuals, such as low-level properties (shape, texture, layout) or high-level features (category of objects, descriptive semantics of scenes) but have typically failed to reconstruct these properties together for complex scene images. Generative AI has recently made a leap forward with latent diffusion models capable of generating high-complexity images. Here, we investigate how to take advantage of this innovative technology for brain decoding. We present a two-stage scene reconstruction framework called ``Brain-Diffuser''. In the first stage, starting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level properties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder) model. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent diffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text and visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images. On the publicly available Natural Scenes Dataset benchmark, our method outperforms previous models both qualitatively and quantitatively. When applied to synthetic fMRI patterns generated from individual ROI (region-of-interest) masks, our trained model creates compelling ``ROI-optimal'' scenes consistent with neuroscientific knowledge. Thus, the proposed methodology can have an impact on both applied (e.g. brain-computer interface) and fundamental neuroscience."}}

To test this hypothesis, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based attention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the ability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and found the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the hardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most important, the corresponding improvements on individual tasks partially explained our novel taxonomy.

However, these neural systems are slow learners producing specialized agents with no mechanism to continue learning beyond their training curriculum. On the contrary, biological synaptic plasticity is persistent and manifold, and has been hypothesized to play a key role in executive functions such as working memory and cognitive flexibility, potentially supporting more efficient and generic learning abilities. Inspired by this, we propose to build networks with dynamic weights, able to continually perform self-reflexive modification as a function of their current synaptic state and action-reward feedback, rather than a fixed network configuration. The resulting model, MetODS (for Meta-Optimized Dynamical Synapses) is a broadly applicable meta-reinforcement learning system able to learn efficient and powerful control rules in the agent policy space. A single layer with dynamic synapses can perform one-shot learning, generalize navigation principles to unseen environments and demonstrates a strong ability to learn adaptive motor policies, comparing favorably with previous meta-reinforcement learning approaches."}}

Prior studies had success in reconstructing either the low-level image features or the semantic/high-level aspects, but rarely both. In this study, we utilized an Instance-Conditioned GAN (IC-GAN) model to reconstruct images from fMRI patterns with both accurate semantic attributes and preserved low-level details. The IC-GAN model takes as input a 119-dim noise vector and a 2048-dim instance feature vector extracted from a target image via a self-supervised learning model (SwAV ResNet-50); these instance features act as a conditioning for IC-GAN image generation, while the noise vector introduces variability between samples. We trained ridge regression models to predict instance features, noise vectors, and dense vectors (the output of the first dense layer of the IC-GAN generator) of stimuli from corresponding fMRI patterns. Then, we used the IC-GAN generator to reconstruct novel test images based on these fMRI-predicted variables. The generated images presented state-of-the-art results in terms of capturing the semantic attributes of the original test images while remaining relatively faithful to low-level image details. Finally, we use the learned regression model and the IC-GAN generator to systematically explore and visualize the semantic features that maximally drive each of several regions-of-interest in the human brain."}}

We extend our analysis to a range of publicly available uni- and multi-modal models. We demonstrate that \"multimodality\" stands out as a key component when assessing the ability of a network to explain the multivoxel activity in the hippocampus."}}
