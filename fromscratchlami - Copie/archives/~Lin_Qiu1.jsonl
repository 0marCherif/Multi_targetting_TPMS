Despite the progress made in integrating pathology and genomic data, most existing methods cannot mine the complex inter-modality relations thoroughly. Additionally, identifying explainable features from these models that govern preclinical discovery and clinical prediction is crucial for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response studies. We propose PONET- a novel biological pathway-informed pathology-genomic deep model that integrates pathological images and genomic data not only to improve survival prediction but also to identify genes and pathways that cause different survival rates in patients. Empirical results on six of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior predictive performance and reveals meaningful biological interpretations. The proposed method establishes insight into how to train biologically informed deep networks on multimodal biomedical data which will have general applicability for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment."}}

We propose a deep interpretable variational canonical correlation analysis (DICCA) for multi-view learning.  The developed model extends the existing latent variable model for linear CCA to nonlinear models through the use of deep generative networks. \nDICCA is designed to disentangle both the shared and view-specific variations for multi-view data. To further make the model more interpretable, we place a sparsity-inducing prior on the latent weight with a structured variational autoencoder that is comprised of view-specific generators. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that our method is competitive across domains."}}

Existing methods rely on the test-level covariates while ignoring metrics about test-level covariates. This strategy may not be optimal for complex large-scale problems, where indirect relations often exist among test-level covariates and auxiliary metrics or covariates. We incorporate auxiliary covariates among test-level covariates in a deep Black-Box framework (named as NeurT-FDR) which boosts statistical power and controls FDR for multiple hypothesis testing. Our method parametrizes the test-level covariates as a neural network and adjusts the auxiliary covariates through a regression framework, which enables flexible handling of high-dimensional features as well as efficient end-to-end optimization. We show that NeurT-FDR makes substantially more discoveries in three real datasets compared to competitive baselines."}}

CCA has applications in many fields, such as genomics and neuroimaging. It can extract meaningful features as well as use these features for subsequent analysis. Although some sparse CCA methods have been developed to deal with high-dimensional problems, they are designed specifically for continuous data and do not consider the integer-valued data from next-generation sequencing platforms that exhibit very low counts for some important features. We propose a model-based probabilistic approach for correlation and canonical correlation estimation for two sparse count data sets (PSCCA). PSCCA demonstrates that correlations and canonical correlations estimated at the natural parameter level are more appropriate than traditional estimation methods applied to the raw data. We demonstrate through simulation studies that PSCCA outperforms other standard correlation approaches and sparse CCA approaches in estimating the true correlations and canonical correlations at the natural parameter level. We further apply the PSCCA method to study the association of miRNA and mRNA expression data sets from a squamous cell lung cancer study, finding that PSCCA can uncover a large number of strongly correlated pairs than standard correlation and other sparse CCA approaches."}}

Thus, it is important to not only integrate data from multiple sources (called multi-view data), but also to incorporate time dependency for deep understanding of the underlying system. We propose a generative model based on variational autoencoder and a recurrent neural network to infer the latent dynamics for multi-view temporal data. This approach allows us to identify the disentangled latent embeddings across views while accounting for the time factor. We invoke our proposed model for analyzing three datasets on which we demonstrate the effectiveness and the interpretability of the model."}}
