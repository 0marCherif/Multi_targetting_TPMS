Unlike the most existing explanation methods, MSInterpreter provides a Message-passing Selection scheme(MSScheme) to select the critical paths for GNNs' message aggregations, which aims at reaching the self-explaination instead of post-hoc explanations. In detail, the elaborate MSScheme is designed to calculate weight factors of message aggregation paths by considering the vanilla structure and node embedding components, where the structure base aims at weight factors among node-induced substructures; on the other hand, the node embedding base focuses on weight factors via node embeddings obtained by one-layer GNN.Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on graph classification benchmarks."}}

We strive to reformulate the conventional model inference pipeline into a graph matching policy that associates the extracted visual concepts of an image with the pre-computed scene impression, by analogy with human reasoning mechanism via impression matching. To this end, we devise an elaborated architecture, termed as SchemaNet, as a dedicated instantiation of the proposed schema inference concept, that models both the visual semantics of input instances and the learned abstract imaginations of target categories as topological relational graphs. Meanwhile, to capture and leverage the compositional contributions of visual semantics in a global view, we also introduce a universal Feat2Graph scheme in SchemaNet to establish the relational graphs that contain abundant interaction information. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed schema inference achieves encouraging performance and meanwhile yields a clear picture of the deductive process leading to the predictions.

Despite their success, existing GNNs typically suffer from the insufficient expressive power bottlenecked by Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, and meanwhile are prone to the over-smoothing situation with increasing layer numbers. In this paper, we strive to strengthen the discriminative capabilities of GNNs by devising a dedicated plug-and-play normalization scheme, termed as Motif-induced Normalization (MotifNorm), that explicitly considers the intra-connection information within each node-induced subgraph. To this end, we embed the motif-induced structural weights at the beginning and the end of the standard BatchNorm, as well as incorporate the graph instance-specific statistics for improved distinguishable capabilities. In the meantime, we provide the theoretical analysis to support that, with the proposed elaborated MotifNorm, an arbitrary GNNs is capable of more expressive abilities than the 1-WL test in distinguishing k-regular graphs. Furthermore, the proposed MotifNorm scheme is also exemplified to be able to alleviate the over-smoothing phenomenon. Experimental results on ten popular benchmarks across all the tasks of the graph-, node-, as well as link-level property predictions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is made available in the supplementary material."}}

However, when directly applying ProtoPNet on vision transformer (ViT) backbones, learned prototypes have a \"distraction\" problem: they have a relatively high probability of being activated by the background and pay less attention to the foreground. The powerful capability of modeling long-term dependency makes the transformer-based ProtoPNet hard to focus on prototypical parts, thus severely impairing its inherent interpretability. This paper proposes prototypical part transformer (ProtoPFormer) for appropriately and effectively applying the prototype-based method with ViTs for interpretable image recognition. The proposed method introduces global and local prototypes for capturing and highlighting the representative holistic and partial features of targets according to the architectural characteristics of ViTs. The global prototypes are adopted to provide the global view of objects to guide local prototypes to concentrate on the foreground while eliminating the influence of the background. Afterwards, local prototypes are explicitly supervised to concentrate on their respective prototypical visual parts, increasing the overall interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed global and local prototypes can mutually correct each other and jointly make final decisions, which faithfully and transparently reason the decision-making processes associatively from the whole and local perspectives, respectively. Moreover, ProtoPFormer consistently achieves superior performance and visualization results over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) prototype-based baselines.

With the general-purpose Transformer architecture replacing the hard-coded inductive biases of convolution, ViTs have surpassed CNNs, especially in data-sufficient circumstances. However, ViTs are prone to over-fit on small datasets and thus rely on large-scale pre-training, which expends enormous time. In this paper, we strive to liberate ViTs from pre-training by introducing CNNs' in- ductive biases back to ViTs while preserving their network architectures for higher upper bound and setting up more suitable optimization objectives. To begin with, an agent CNN is designed based on the given ViT with inductive bi-ases. Then a bootstrapping training algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the agent and ViT with weight sharing, during which the ViT learns inductive biases from the intermediate features of the agent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1k with limited training data have shown encouraging results that the inductive biases help ViTs converge significantly faster and outperform conventional CNNs with even fewer parameters.

Currently, most of these approaches are tailored for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there is a tendency that transformers, with a completely different architecture, are starting to challenge the domination of CNNs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, directly applying the previous KA methods to transformers leads to severe performance degradation. In this work, we explore a more effective KA scheme for transformer-based object detection models. Specifically, considering the architecture characteristics of transformers, we propose to dissolve the KA into two aspects: sequence-level amalgamation (SA) and task-level amalgamation (TA). In particular, a hint is generated within the sequence-level amalgamation by concatenating teacher sequences instead of redundantly aggregating them to a fixed-size one as previous KA works. Besides, the student learns heterogeneous detection tasks through soft targets with efficiency in the task-level amalgamation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO have unfolded that the sequence-level amalgamation significantly boosts the performance of students, while the previous methods impair the students. Moreover, the transformer-based students excel in learning amalgamated knowledge, as they have mastered heterogeneous detection tasks rapidly and achieved superior or at least comparable performance to those of the teachers in their specializations."}}

Despite the encouraging results achieved, state-of-the-art DFKD methods still suffer from the inefficiency of data synthesis, making the data-free training process extremely time-consuming and thus inapplicable for large-scale tasks. In this work, we introduce an efficacious scheme, termed as FastDFKD, that allows us to accelerate DFKD by a factor of orders of magnitude. At the heart of our approach is a novel strategy to reuse the shared common features in training data so as to synthesize different data instances. Unlike prior methods that optimize a set of data independently, we propose to learn a meta-synthesizer that seeks common features as the initialization for the fast data synthesis. As a result, FastDFKD achieves data synthesis within only a few steps, significantly enhancing the efficiency of data-free training. Experiments over CIFAR, NYUv2, and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed FastDFKD achieves 10x and even 100x acceleration while preserving performances on par with state of the art.
