For example, in hardware design optimization, we need to find the designs that trade-off performance, energy, and area overhead using expensive simulations. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware search framework referred to as USeMO to efficiently select the sequence of inputs for evaluation to solve this problem. The selection method of USeMO consists of solving a cheap MO optimization problem via surrogate models of the true functions to identify the most promising candidates and picking the best candidate based on a measure of uncertainty. We also provide theoretical analysis to characterize the efficacy of our approach. Our experiments on several synthetic and six diverse real-world benchmark problems show that USeMO consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance, area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method, referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead, execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost. CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from NSGA-II."}}

This paper addresses the BO problem setting for combinatorial spaces (e.g., sequences and graphs) that occurs naturally in science and engineering applications. A prototypical example is molecular optimization guided by expensive experiments. The key challenge is to balance the complexity of statistical models and tractability of search to select combinatorial structures for evaluation. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach referred as Mercer Features for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization (MerCBO). The key idea behind MerCBO is to provide explicit feature maps for diffusion kernels over discrete objects by exploiting the structure of their combinatorial graph representation. These Mercer features combined with Thompson sampling as the acquisition function allows us to employ efficient solvers for finding the next structure for evaluation. Experimental evaluation on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrates that MerCBO performs similarly or better than prior methods."}}

For example, placement of functional blocks in hardware design to optimize performance via simulations. The overall goal is to minimize the number of function evaluations to find high-performing permutations. The key challenge in solving this problem using the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework is to trade-off the complexity of statistical model and tractability of acquisition function optimization. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two algorithms for BO over Permutation Spaces (BOPS). First, BOPS-T employs Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model with Kendall kernels and a Tractable acquisition function optimization approach based on Thompson sampling to select the sequence of permutations for evaluation. Second, BOPS-H employs GP surrogate model with Mallow kernels and a Heuristic search approach to optimize expected improvement acquisition function. We theoretically analyze the performance of BOPS-T to show that their regret grows sub-linearly. Our experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that both BOPS-T and BOPS-H perform better than the state-of-the-art BO algorithm for combinatorial spaces. To drive future research on this important problem, we make new resources and real-world benchmarks available to the community."}}
