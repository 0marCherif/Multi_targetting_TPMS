There are several variants of the similarity search problem, and one of the most relevant is the r-near neighbor (r-NN) problem: given a radius r>0 and a set of points S, construct a data structure that, for any given query point q, returns a point p within distance at most r from q. In this paper, we study the r-NN problem in the light of fairness. We consider fairness in the sense of equal opportunity: all points that are within distance r from the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the theoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does not provide such a fairness guarantee. To address this, we propose efficient data structures for r-NN where all points in S that are near q have the same probability to be selected and returned by the query. Specifically, we first propose a black-box approach that, given any LSH scheme, constructs a data structure for uniformly sampling points in the neighborhood of a query. Then, we develop a data structure for fair similarity search under inner product that requires nearly-linear space and exploits locality sensitive filters. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation that highlights (un)fairness in a recommendation setting on real-world datasets and discusses the inherent unfairness introduced by solving other variants of the problem."}}

Although stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used for large scale machine learning, it sometimes experiences slow convergence rates due to the high variance from uniform sampling. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that approximately samples a gradient from the optimal distribution for a common finite-sum form with $n$ terms, while just making a single pass over the data, using input sparsity time, and $\\tO{Td}$ space. Our algorithm can be implemented in big data models such as the streaming and distributed models. Moreover, we show that our algorithm can be generalized to approximately sample Hessians and thus provides variance reduction for second-order methods as well. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on large-scale datasets. "}}

Namely, given a set of $n$ points $P$ and a parameter $r$, the goal is to preprocess the points, such that given a query point $q$, any point in the $r$-neighborhood of the query, i.e., $B(q,r)$, have the same probability of being reported as the near neighbor.  We show that LSH based algorithms can be made fair, without a significant loss in efficiency. Specifically, we show an algorithm that reports a point $p$ in the $r$-neighborhood of a query $q$ with almost uniform probability.  The time to report such a point is proportional to $O(\\dns(q.r) Q(n,c))$, and its space is $O(S(n,c))$, where $Q(n,c)$ and $S(n,c)$ are the query time and space of an LSH algorithm for $c$-approximate near neighbor, and $\\dns(q,r)$ is a function of the local density around $q$.  Our approach works more generally for sampling uniformly from a sub-collection of sets of a given collection and can be used in a few other applications. Finally, we run experiments to show performance of our approach on real data."}}

In this work, we consider efficient construction of composable core-sets for the determinant maximization problem. This can also be cast as the MAP inference task for \u201cdeterminantal point processes\", that have recently gained a lot of interest for modeling diversity and fairness. The problem was recently studied in \\cite{indyk2018composable}, where they designed composable core-sets with the optimal approximation bound of $O(k)^k$. On the other hand, the more practical \u201cGreedy\" algorithm has been previously used in similar contexts. In this work, first we provide a theoretical approximation guarantee of $C^{k^2}$ for the Greedy algorithm in the context of composable core-sets; Further, we propose to use a \u201cLocal Search\" based algorithm that while being still practical, achieves a nearly optimal approximation bound of $O(k)^{2k}$; Finally, we implement all three algorithms and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on standard data sets."}}

Such user-generated content tends to carry additional information such as entities and sentiment. In general, when articles are recommended to users, only popularity (e.g., most shared and most commented), recency, and sometimes (manual) editors' picks (based on daily hot topics), are considered. We formalize a novel recommendation problem where the goal is to find the closest most diverse articles to the one the user is currently browsing. Our diversity measure incorporates entities and sentiment extracted from comments. Given the real-time nature of our recommendations, we explore the applicability of nearest neighbor algorithms to solve the problem. Our user study on real opinion articles from aljazeera.net and reuters.com validates the use of entities and sentiment extracted from articles and their comments to achieve news diversity when compared to content-based diversity. Finally, our performance experiments show the real-time feasibility of our solution."}}
