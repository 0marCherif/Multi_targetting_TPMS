Directly applying methods for image or video stylization to 3D scenes cannot achieve such consistency. Thanks to recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF), we are able to represent a 3D scene in a consistent way. Consistent 3D scene stylization can be effectively achieved by stylizing the corresponding NeRF. However, there is a  significant domain gap between style examples which are 2D images and NeRF which is an implicit volumetric representation. To address this problem, we propose a novel mutual learning framework for 3D scene stylization that combines a 2D image stylization network and NeRF to fuse the stylization ability of 2D stylization network with the 3D consistency of NeRF. We first pre-train a standard NeRF of the 3D scene to be stylized and replace its color prediction module with a style network to obtain a stylized NeRF. It is followed by distilling the prior knowledge of spatial consistency from NeRF to the 2D stylization network through an introduced consistency loss. We also introduce a mimic loss to supervise the mutual learning of the NeRF style module and fine-tune the 2D stylization decoder. In order to further make our model handle ambiguities of 2D stylization results, we introduce learnable latent codes that obey the probability distributions  conditioned on the style. They are attached to training samples as conditional inputs to better learn the style module in our novel stylized NeRF. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to existing approaches in both visual quality and long-range  consistency."}}

However, existing representations, such as parametric models, voxel grids, meshes and implicit neural representations, have difficulties achieving high-quality results and real-time speed at the same time. In this paper, we propose Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF), a novel, powerful, efficient and flexible 3D geometry representation, for monocular real-time and accurate human reconstruction. A FOF represents a 3D object with a 2D field orthogonal to the view direction where at each 2D position the occupancy field of the object along the view direction is compactly represented with the first few terms of Fourier series, which retains the topology and neighborhood relation in the 2D domain. A FOF can be stored as a multi-channel image, which is compatible with 2D convolutional neural networks and can bridge the gap between 3D geometries and 2D images. A FOF is very flexible and extensible, \\eg, parametric models can be easily integrated into a FOF as a prior to generate more robust results. Meshes and our FOF can be easily inter-converted. Based on FOF, we design the first 30+FPS high-fidelity real-time monocular human reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the potential of FOF on both public datasets and real captured data.

However, state-of-the-art single-style methods can only generate one style of cartoon images from photos and existing multi-style image style transfer methods still struggle to produce high-quality cartoon images due to their highly simplified and abstract nature. In this article, we propose a novel multi-style generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, called MS-CartoonGAN, which can transform photos into multiple cartoon styles. MS-CartoonGAN uses only unpaired photos and cartoon images of multiple styles for training. To achieve this, we propose to use (1) a hierarchical semantic loss with sparse regularization to retain semantic content and recover flat shading in different abstract levels, (2) a new edge-promoting adversarial loss for producing fine edges, and (3) a style loss to enhance the difference between output cartoon styles and make training process more stable. We also develop a multi-domain architecture, where the generator consists of a shared encoder and multiple decoders for different cartoon styles, along with multiple discriminators for individual styles. By observing that cartoon images drawn by different artists have their unique styles while sharing some common characteristics, our shared network architecture exploits the common characteristics of cartoon styles, achieving better cartoonization and being more efficient than single-style cartoonization. We show that our multi-domain architecture can theoretically guarantee to output desired multiple cartoon styles. Through extensive experiments including a user study, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art single-style and multi-style image style transfer methods."}}

Several methods have recently been developed, with an aim to extract intuitive and interpretable deformation components. However, these techniques suffer from fundamental limitations especially for meshes with noise or large-scale nonlinear deformations, and may not always be able to identify important deformation components. In this paper we propose a mesh-based variational autoencoder architecture that is able to cope with meshes with irregular connectivity and nonlinear deformations, assuming that the analyzed dataset contains meshes with the same vertex connectivity, which is common for deformation analysis. To help localize deformations, we introduce sparse regularization in this framework, along with spectral graph convolutional operations. Through modifying the regularization formulation and allowing dynamic change of sparsity ranges, we improve the visual quality and reconstruction ability of the extracted deformation components. Our system also provides a nonlinear approach to reconstruction of meshes using the extracted basis, which is more effective than the current linear combination approach. As an important application of localized deformation components and a novel approach on its own, we further develop a neural shape editing method, achieving shape editing and deformation component extraction in a unified framework, and ensuring plausibility of the edited shapes. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for neural shape editing."}}

To achieve this, researchers have long been focusing on shape analysis to develop new interpolation and extrapolation techniques. However, such techniques have limited learning capabilities and therefore often produce unrealistic deformation. Although there are already networks defined on individual meshes, deep architectures that operate directly on mesh sequences with temporal information remain unexplored due to the following major barriers: irregular mesh connectivity, rich temporal information, and varied deformation. To address these issues, we utilize convolutional neural networks defined on triangular meshes along with a shape deformation representation to extract useful features, followed by long short-term memory (LSTM) that iteratively processes the features. To fully respect the bidirectional nature of actions, we propose a new share-weight bidirectional scheme to better synthesize deformations. An extensive evaluation shows that our approach outperforms existing methods in sequence generation, both qualitatively and quantitatively."}}

In the past few years, widely available touchscreen devices have increasingly made sketch-based human-AI co-creation applications popular. One key issue of sketch-oriented interaction is to prepare input sketches efficiently by non-professionals because it is usually difficult and time-consuming to draw an ideal sketch with appropriate outlines and rich details, especially for novice users with no sketching skills. Thus, sketching brings great obstacles for sketch applications in daily life. On the other hand, hand-drawn sketches are scarce and hard to collect. Given the fact that there are several large-scale sketch datasets providing sketch data resources, but they usually have a limited number of objects and categories in sketch, and do not support users to collect new sketch materials according to their personal preferences. In addition, few sketch-related applications support the reuse of existing sketch elements. Thus, knowing how to extract sketches from existing drawings and effectively re-use them in interactive scene sketch composition will provide an elegant way for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) applications, which are widely used in various touch screen devices. In this study, we first conduct a study on current SBIR to better understand the main requirements and challenges in sketch-oriented applications. Then we develop the SketchMaker as an interactive sketch extraction and composition system to help users generate scene sketches via reusing object sketches in existing scene sketches with minimal manual intervention. Moreover, we demonstrate how SBIR improves from composited scene sketches to verify the performance of our interactive sketch processing system. We also include a sketch-based video localization task as an alternative application of our sketch composition scheme. Our pilot study shows that our system is effective and efficient, and provides a way to promote practical applications of sketches."}}
