Combining bottom-up grouping with top-down detection and tracking, although highly desirable, is a challenging problem. We state this joint problem as a co-clustering problem that is principled and tractable by existing algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by combining bottom-up motion segmentation by grouping of point trajectories with high-level multiple object tracking by clustering of bounding boxes. We show that solving the joint problem is beneficial at the low-level, in terms of the FBMS59 motion segmentation benchmark, and at the high-level, in terms of the Multiple Object Tracking benchmarks MOT15, MOT16, and the MOT17 challenge, and is state-of-the-art in some metrics."}}

We propose persistency criteria for the multicut and max-cut problem as well as fast combinatorial routines to verify them. The criteria that we derive are based on mappings that improve feasible multicuts, respectively cuts. Our elementary criteria can be checked enumeratively. The more advanced ones rely on fast algorithms for upper and lower bounds for the respective cut problems and max-flow techniques for auxiliary min-cut problems. Our methods can be used as a preprocessing technique for reducing problem sizes or for computing partial optimality guarantees for solutions output by heuristic solvers. We show the efficacy of our methods on instances of both problems from computer vision, biomedical image analysis and statistical physics."}}

Abstract In vitro experiments with cultured cells are essential for studying their growth and migration pattern and thus, for gaining a better understanding of cancer progression and its treatment. Recent progress in lens-free microscopy (LFM) has rendered it an inexpensive tool for label-free, continuous live cell imaging, yet there is only little work on analysing such time-lapse image sequences. We propose (1) a cell detector for LFM images based on fully convolutional networks and residual learning, and (2) a probabilistic model based on moral lineage tracing that explicitly handles multiple detections and temporal successor hypotheses by clustering and tracking simultaneously. (3) We benchmark our method in terms of detection and tracking scores on a dataset of three annotated sequences of several hours of LFM, where we demonstrate our method to produce high quality lineages. (4) We evaluate its performance on a somewhat more challenging problem: estimating cell lineages from the LFM sequence as would be possible from a corresponding fluorescence microscopy sequence. We present experiments on 16 LFM sequences for which we acquired fluorescence microscopy in parallel and generated annotations from them. Finally, (5) we showcase our methods effectiveness for quantifying cell dynamics in an experiment with skin cancer cells.

The considered task is posed as a joint optimization problem in the continuous classifier parameters and the discrete label variables. In contrast to prior approaches such as convex relaxations, we propose an advantageous decoupling of the objective function into discrete and continuous subproblems and a novel, efficient optimization method related to ADMM. This approach preserves integrality of the discrete label variables and guarantees global convergence to a critical point. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in several experiments including video object segmentation on the DAVIS data set and interactive image segmentation."}}

Although the local search algorithms establish neither lower bounds nor approximation certificates, they converge monotonously to a fixpoint, offering a feasible solution at any time. For some algorithms, the time of convergence is affordable for all instances we consider. This finding encourages a broader application of correlation clustering, especially in settings where the number of clusters is not known and needs to be estimated from\u00a0data."}}

Our starting point is a model that resembles existing architectures for single-frame pose estimation but is substantially faster. We achieve this in two ways: (1) by simplifying and sparsifying the body-part relationship graph and leveraging recent methods for faster inference, and (2) by offloading a substantial share of computation onto a feed-forward convolutional architecture that is able to detect and associate body joints of the same person even in clutter. We use this model to generate proposals for body joint locations and formulate articulated tracking as spatio-temporal grouping of such proposals. This allows to jointly solve the association problem for all people in the scene by propagating evidence from strong detections through time and enforcing constraints that each proposal can be assigned to one person only. We report results on a public MPII Human Pose benchmark and on a new MPII Video Pose dataset of image sequences with multiple people. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results while using only a fraction of time and is able to leverage temporal information to improve state-of-the-art for crowded scenes."}}
