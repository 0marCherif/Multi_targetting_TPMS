Our model generalizes prior CoPE formulation with the single-task and classic MAB setting to allow multiple tasks and general reward structures. We propose a novel communication scheme with an efficient kernelized estimator, and design optimal algorithms CoKernelFC and CoKernelFB for CoPE-KB with fixed-confidence  and fixed-budget objectives, respectively. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds in both sampling and communication complexity are established to demonstrate the optimality of our algorithms. Our theoretical results explicitly quantify how task similarities influence learning speedup, and only depend on the effective dimension of feature space. Our novel techniques including an efficient kernelized estimator and linear structured instance transformation, which overcome the communication difficulty in high-dimensional feature space and derive communication round lower bounds, can be of independent interests.

None of the existing CPE studies (most of them assume linear rewards) can be adapted to solve such challenges, and thus we develop brand-new techniques to handle them.\nFor the FC setting, we propose novel algorithms with optimal sample complexity for a broad family of instances and establish a matching lower bound to demonstrate the optimality (within a logarithmic factor).\nFor the FB setting, we design an algorithm which achieves the state-of-the-art error probability guarantee and is the first to run efficiently on fixed-budget path instances, compared to existing CPE algorithms. \nOur experimental results on the top-$k$, path and matching instances validate the empirical superiority of the proposed algorithms over their baselines."}}

The objective is to identify the optimal action with the highest expected reward, using as few samples as possible. For CPE-BL, we design the first {\\em polynomial-time adaptive} algorithm, whose sample complexity matches the lower bound (within a logarithmic factor) for a family of instances and has a light dependence of $\\Delta_{\\min}$ (the smallest gap between the optimal action and sub-optimal actions). Furthermore, we propose a novel generalization of CPE-BL with flexible feedback structures, called combinatorial pure exploration with partial linear feedback (CPE-PL), which encompasses several families of sub-problems including full-bandit feedback, semi-bandit feedback, partial feedback and nonlinear reward functions. In CPE-PL, each pull of action $x$ reports a random feedback vector with expectation of $M_{x} \\theta $, where $M_x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m_x \\times d}$ is a transformation matrix for $x$, and gains a random (possibly nonlinear) reward related to $x$. For CPE-PL, we develop the first {\\em polynomial-time} algorithm, which simultaneously addresses limited feedback, general reward function and combinatorial action space, and provide its sample complexity analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our algorithms run orders of magnitude faster than the existing ones, and our CPE-BL algorithm is robust across different $\\Delta_{\\min}$ settings while our CPE-PL algorithm is the only one returning correct answers for nonlinear reward functions."}}

This is a fundamental graph-mining task with a variety of applications and thus has received much attention recently. Although most existing methods assume that each individual edge weight is easily obtained, such an assumption is not necessarily valid in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning problem for dense subgraph discovery in which a learner queries edge subsets rather than only single edges and observes a noisy sum of edge weights in a queried subset. For this problem, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm that obtains a nearly-optimal solution with high probability. Moreover, to deal with large-sized graphs, we design a more scalable algorithm with a theoretical guarantee. Computational experiments using real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms."}}

When developing an algorithm for combinatorial optimization, it is commonly assumed that parameters such as edge weights are exactly known as inputs. However, this assumption may not be fulfilled since input parameters are often uncertain or initially unknown in many applications such as recommender systems, crowdsourcing, communication networks, and online advertisement. To resolve such uncertainty, the problem of combinatorial pure exploration of multi-armed bandits (CPE) and its variants have recieved increasing attention. Earlier work on CPE has studied the semi-bandit feedback or assumed that the outcome from each individual edge is always accessible at all rounds. However, due to practical constraints such as a budget ceiling or privacy concern, such strong feedback is not always available in recent applications. In this article, we review recently proposed techniques for combinatorial pure exploration problems with limited feedback."}}

Most work so far has considered the semi-bandit setting, where the agent can observe the reward of each pulled arm or assumed each arm can be queried at each round. However, in real-world applications, it is costly or sometimes impossible to observe a reward of individual arms. In this study, we tackle the full-bandit setting, where only a noisy observation of the total sum of a super arm is given at each pull. Although our problem can be regarded as an instance of the best arm identification in linear bandits, a naive approach based on linear bandits is computationally infeasible since the number of super arms K is exponential. To cope with this problem, we first design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for a 0-1 quadratic programming problem arising in confidence ellipsoid maximization. Based on our approximation algorithm, we propose a bandit algorithm whose computation time is O(log K), thereby achieving an exponential speedup over linear bandit algorithms. We provide a sample complexity upper bound that is still worst-case optimal. Finally, we conduct experiments on large-scale data sets with more than 1010 super arms, demonstrating the superiority of our algorithms in terms of both the computation time and the sample complexity."}}

In cases where a few experts are overwhelmed by a large number of non-experts, most answer aggregation algorithms such as the majority voting fail to identify the correct answers. Therefore, it is crucial to extract reliable experts from the crowd workers. In this study, we introduce the notion of \"expert core\", which is a set of workers that is very unlikely to contain a non-expert. We design a graph-mining-based efficient algorithm that exactly computes the expert core. To answer the aggregation task, we propose two types of algorithms. The first one incorporates the expert core into existing answer aggregation algorithms such as the majority voting, whereas the second one utilizes information provided by the expert core extraction algorithm pertaining to the reliability of workers. We then give a theoretical justification for the first type of algorithm. Computational experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed answer aggregation algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms."}}
