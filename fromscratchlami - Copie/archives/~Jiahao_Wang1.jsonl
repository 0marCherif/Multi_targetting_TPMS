This challenge is held to address the emerging challenge of IQA by perceptual image processing algorithms. The output images of these algorithms have completely different characteristics from traditional distortions and are included in the PIPAL dataset used in this challenge. This challenge is divided into two tracks, a full-reference IQA track similar to the previous NTIRE IQA challenge and a new track that focuses on the no-reference IQA methods. The challenge has 192 and 179 registered participants for two tracks. In the final testing stage, 7 and 8 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all of them have achieved better results than existing IQA methods, and the winning method can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance."}}

In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have achieved promising success on video deblurring task. However, the models trained on existing synthetic datasets still suffer from generalization problems over real-world blurry scenarios with undesired artifacts. The factors accounting for the failure remain unknown. Therefore, we revisit the classical blur synthesis pipeline and figure out the possible reasons, including shooting parameters, blur formation space, and image signal processor~(ISP). To analyze the effects of these potential factors, we first collect an ultra-high frame-rate (940 FPS) RAW video dataset as the data basis to synthesize various kinds of blurs. Then we propose a novel realistic blur synthesis pipeline termed as RAW-Blur by leveraging blur formation cues. Through numerous experiments, we demonstrate that synthesizing blurs in the RAW space and adopting the same ISP as the real-world testing data can effectively eliminate the negative effects of synthetic data. Furthermore, the shooting parameters of the synthesized blurry video, e.g., exposure time and frame-rate play significant roles in improving the performance of deblurring models. Impressively, the models trained on the blurry data synthesized by the proposed RAW-Blur pipeline can obtain more than 5dB PSNR gain against those trained on the existing synthetic blur datasets. We believe the novel realistic synthesis pipeline and the corresponding RAW video dataset can help the community to easily construct customized blur datasets to improve real-world video deblurring performance largely, instead of laboriously collecting real data pairs."}}

Unfortunately, there is a performance drop when assessing the distortion images generated by generative adversarial network (GAN) with seemingly realistic textures. In this work, we conjecture that this maladaptation lies in the backbone of IQA models, where patch-level prediction methods use independent image patches as input to calculate their scores separately, but lack spatial relationship modeling among image patches. Therefore, we propose an Attention-based Hybrid Image Quality Assessment Network (AHIQ) to deal with the challenge and get better performance on the GAN-based IQA task. Firstly, we adopt a two-branch architecture, including a vision transformer (ViT) branch and a convolutional neural network (CNN) branch for feature extraction. The hybrid architecture combines interaction information among image patches captured by ViT and local texture details from CNN. To make the features from the shallow CNN more focused on the visually salient region, a deformable convolution is applied with the help of semantic information from the ViT branch. Finally, we use a patch-wise score prediction module to obtain the final score. The experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four standard IQA datasets and AHIQ ranked first on the Full Reference (FR) track of the NTIRE 2022 Perceptual Image Quality Assessment Challenge.

Recent memory network-based methods focus on exploiting inter-frame temporal reference while paying little attention to intra-frame spatial dependency. Specifically, these segmentation model tends to be susceptible to interference from unrelated nontarget objects in a certain frame. To this end, we propose Global Spectral Filter Memory network (GSFM), which improves intra-frame interaction through learning long-term spatial dependencies in the spectral domain. The key components of GSFM is 2D (inverse) discrete Fourier transform for spatial information mixing. Besides, we empirically find low frequency feature should be enhanced in encoder (backbone) while high frequency for decoder (segmentation head). We attribute this to semantic information extracting role for encoder and fine-grained details highlighting role for decoder. Thus, Low (High) Frequency Module is proposed to fit this circumstance. Extensive experiments on the popular DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks demonstrate that GSFM noticeably outperforms the baseline method and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, extensive analysis shows that the proposed modules are reasonable and of great generalization ability. Our source code is available at https://github.com/workforai/GSFM."}}

Mobile devices in the consumer market with CMOS-based sensors for video capture often result in rolling shutter effects when relative movements occur during the video acquisition process, calling for RS effect removal techniques. However, current state-of-the-art RS correction methods often fail to remove RS effects in real scenarios since the motions are various and hard to model. To address this issue, we propose a real-world RS correction dataset BS-RSC. Real distorted videos with corresponding ground truth are recorded simultaneously via a well-designed beam-splitter-based acquisition system. BS-RSC contains various motions of both camera and objects in dynamic scenes. Further, an RS correction model with adaptive warping is proposed. Our model can warp the learned RS features into global shutter counterparts adaptively with predicted multiple displacement fields. These warped features are aggregated and then reconstructed into high-quality global shutter frames in a coarse-to-fine strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and our dataset can improve the model's ability to remove the RS effects in the real world.

A feasible strategy is to compress them using the original training data, which may be not accessible due to privacy limitations or transmission restrictions. In this case, utilizing the massive unlabeled data in the wild is an alternative paradigm, which has been proved effective for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, due to the significant differences in model structure and computation mechanism between CNNs and ViTs, it is still an open issue that whether the similar paradigm is suitable for ViTs. In this work, we propose to effectively compress ViTs using the unlabeled data in the wild, consisting of two stages. First, we design an effective tool in selecting valuable data from the wild, dubbed Attention Probe. Second, based on the selected data, we develop a probe knowledge distillation algorithm to train a lightweight student transformer, through maximizing the similarities on both the outputs and intermediate features, between the heavy teacher and the lightweight student models. Extensive experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the student transformer obtained by the proposed method can achieve comparable performance with the baseline that requires the original training data.
