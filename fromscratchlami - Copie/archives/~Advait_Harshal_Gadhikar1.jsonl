It has been shown for multiple architectures that initial dynamical isometry is particularly advantageous. Known initialization schemes for residual blocks, however, miss this property and suffer from degrading separability of different inputs for increasing depth and instability without Batch Normalization or lack feature diversity. We propose a random initialization scheme, Risotto, that achieves perfect dynamical isometry for residual networks with ReLU activation functions even for finite depth and width. It balances the contributions of the residual and skip branches unlike other schemes, which initially bias towards the skip connections. In experiments, we demonstrate that in most cases our approach outperforms initialization schemes proposed to make Batch Normalization obsolete, including Fixup and SkipInit, and facilitates stable training. Also in combination with Batch Normalization, we find that Risotto often achieves the overall best result. "}}

The resulting Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi (ER) random graphs can often compete with dense architectures and state-of-the-art lottery ticket pruning algorithms struggle to outperform them, even though the random baselines do not rely on computationally expensive pruning-training iterations but can be drawn initially without significant computational overhead. We offer a theoretical explanation of how such ER masks can approximate arbitrary target networks if they are wider by a logarithmic factor in the inverse sparsity $1 / \\log(1/\\text{sparsity})$. While we are the first to show theoretically and experimentally that random ER source networks contain strong lottery tickets, we also prove the existence of weak lottery tickets that require a lower degree of overparametrization than strong lottery tickets. These unusual results are based on the observation that ER masks are well trainable in practice, which we verify in experiments with varied choices of random masks. Some of these data-free choices outperform previously proposed random approaches on standard image classification benchmark datasets. "}}

We offer a theoretical explanation of how random masks can approximate arbitrary target networks if they are wider by a logarithmic factor in the inverse sparsity $1 / \\log(1/\\text{sparsity})$. This overparameterization factor is necessary at least for 3-layer random networks, which elucidates the observed degrading performance of random networks at higher sparsity. At moderate to high sparsity levels, however, our results imply that sparser networks are contained within random source networks so that any dense-to-sparse training scheme can be turned into a computationally more efficient sparse-to-sparse one by constraining the search to a fixed random mask. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in experiments for different pruning methods and propose particularly effective choices of initial layer-wise sparsity ratios of the random source network. As a special case, we show theoretically and experimentally that random source networks also contain strong lottery tickets."}}
