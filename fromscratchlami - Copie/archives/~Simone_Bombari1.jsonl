We introduce Relational Memorization (RM) to understand, quantify and control this phenomenon. While bounding general memorization can have detrimental effects on the performance of a trained model, bounding RM does not prevent effective learning. The difference is most pronounced when the data distribution is long-tailed, with many queries having only few training examples: Impeding general memorization prevents effective learning, while impeding only relational memorization still allows learning general properties of the underlying concepts. We formalize the notion of Relational Privacy (RP) and, inspired by Differential Privacy (DP), we provide a possible definition of Differential Relational Privacy (DrP). These notions can be used to describe and compute bounds on the amount of RM in a trained model. We illustrate Relational Privacy concepts in experiments with large-scale models for Question Answering."}}

A line of work has studied the NTK spectrum for two-layer and deep networks with at least a layer with $\\Omega(N)$ neurons, $N$ being the number of training samples. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence suggesting that deep networks with sub-linear layer widths are powerful memorizers and optimizers, as long as the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples. Thus, a natural open question is whether the NTK is well conditioned in such a challenging sub-linear setup. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our key technical contribution is a lower bound on the smallest NTK eigenvalue for deep networks with the minimum possible over-parameterization: up to logarithmic factors, the number of parameters is $\\Omega(N)$ and, hence, the number of neurons is as little as $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$. To showcase the applicability of our NTK bounds, we provide two results concerning memorization capacity and optimization guarantees for gradient descent training."}}
