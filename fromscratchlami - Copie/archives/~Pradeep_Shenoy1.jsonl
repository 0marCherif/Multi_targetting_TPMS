However, learning unbiased models depends on building a dataset that is representative of a diverse range of realistic scenarios for a given task. This is challenging in many settings where data comes from high-volume streams, with each scenario occurring in random interleaved episodes at varying frequencies. We study realistic streaming settings where data instances arrive in and are sampled from an episodic multi-distributional data stream. Using submodular information measures, we propose STREAMLINE, a novel streaming active learning framework that mitigates scenario-driven slice imbalance in the working labeled data via a three-step procedure of slice identification, slice-aware budgeting, and data selection. We extensively evaluate STREAMLINE on real-world streaming scenarios for image classification and object detection tasks. We observe that STREAMLINE improves the performance on infrequent yet critical slices of the data over current baselines by up to 5% in terms of accuracy on our image classification tasks and by up to 8% in terms of mAP on our object detection tasks."}}

Existing meta-learning techniques use two complementary approaches of either learning a low-dimensional representation of points for all tasks, or task-specific fine-tuning of a global model trained using all the tasks. In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that combines both the techniques to enable handling of a large number of data-starved tasks. Our framework models network weights as a sum of low-rank  and sparse matrices. This allows us to capture information from multiple domains together in the low-rank part while still allowing task specific personalization using the sparse part.  We instantiate and study the framework in the linear setting, where the problem reduces to that of estimating the sum of a rank-$r$ and a $k$-column sparse matrix using a small number of linear measurements. We propose an alternating minimization method with hard thresholding -- AMHT-LRS -- to learn the low-rank and sparse part effectively and efficiently. For the realizable, Gaussian data setting, we show that AMHT-LRS indeed solves the problem efficiently with nearly optimal samples.  We extend  AMHT-LRS  to ensure that it preserves privacy of each individual user in the dataset, while still ensuring strong  generalization with nearly optimal number of samples. Finally, on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the framework allows personalized models to obtain superior performance in the data-scarce regime."}}

For instance, knowledge distillation aims to mimic outputs of a powerful teacher model; similarly, in rule-based approaches, weak labeling information is provided by labeling functions which may be noisy rule-based approximations to true labels. We tackle the problem of learning to combine these losses in a principled manner. Our proposal, AMAL, uses a bi-level optimization criterion on validation data to learn optimal mixing weights, at an instance level, over the training data. We describe a meta-learning approach towards solving this bi-level objective and show how it can be applied to different scenarios in supervised learning. Experiments in a number of knowledge distillation and rule-denoising domains show that AMAL provides noticeable gains over competitive baselines in those domains. We empirically analyze our method and share insights into the mechanisms through which it provides performance gains."}}

Standard personalization approaches involve learning a user/domain specific embedding that is fed into a fixed global model which can be limiting. On the other hand, personalizing/fine-tuning model itself for each user/domain -- a.k.a meta-learning -- has high storage/infrastructure cost. We propose a novel meta-learning style approach that models network weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse matrices. This captures common information from multiple individuals/users together in the low-rank part while sparse part captures user-specific idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, the framework is up to two orders of magnitude more scalable (in terms of storage/infrastructure cost) than user-specific finetuning of model. We then study the framework in the linear setting, where the problem reduces to that of estimating the sum of a rank-$r$ and a $k$-column sparse matrix using a small number of linear measurements.

A significant challenge in personalization is ensuring privacy of each user's sensitive data. We alleviate this problem by proposing a differentially private variant of our method that also is equipped with strong generalization guarantees.

In this paper, we propose FLOAT, a factorized label space framework for scalable multi-object multi-part parsing. Our framework involves independent dense prediction of object category and part attributes which increases scalability and reduces task complexity compared to the monolithic label space counterpart. In addition, we propose an inference-time 'zoom' refinement technique which significantly improves segmentation quality, especially for smaller objects/parts. Compared to state of the art, FLOAT obtains an absolute improvement of 2.0% for mean IOU (mIOU) and 4.8% for segmentation quality IOU (sqIOU) on the Pascal-Part-58 dataset. For the larger Pascal-Part-108 dataset, the improvements are 2.1% for mIOU and 3.9% for sqIOU. We incorporate previously excluded part attributes and other minor parts of the Pascal-Part dataset to create the most comprehensive and challenging version which we dub Pascal-Part-201. FLOAT obtains improvements of 8.6% for mIOU and 7.5% for sqIOU on the new dataset, demonstrating its parsing effectiveness across a challenging diversity of objects and parts.

A major challenge for CL systems is catastrophic forgetting, where earlier tasks are forgotten while learning a new task. To address this, replay-based CL approaches maintain and repeatedly retrain on a small buffer of data selected across encountered tasks. We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel strategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed optimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a \u2018coreset\u2019 that closely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to current model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective application to the continual learning setting. We show significant gains (2%-4% absolute) over the state-of-the-art in the well-studied offline continual learning setting. Our findings also effectively transfer to online / streaming CL settings, showing up to 5% gains over existing approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the value of supervised contrastive loss for continual learning, which yields a cumulative gain of up to 5% accuracy when combined with our subset selection strategy."}}

Although extensively studied, likelihoods produced by deep generative models have been largely dismissed as being impractical for outlier detection. First, deep generative model likelihoods are readily biased by low-level input statistics. Second, many recent solutions for correcting these biases are computationally expensive, or do not generalize well to complex, natural datasets. Here, we explore outlier detection with a state-of-the-art deep autoregressive model: PixelCNN++. We show that biases in PixelCNN++ likelihoods arise primarily from predictions based on local dependencies. We propose two families of bijective transformations -- ``stirring'' and ``shaking'' -- which ameliorate low-level biases and isolate the contribution of long-range dependencies to PixelCNN++ likelihoods. These transformations are inexpensive and readily computed at evaluation time. We test our approaches extensively with five grayscale and six natural image datasets and show that they achieve or exceed state-of-the-art outlier detection, particularly on datasets with complex, natural images. We also show that our solutions work well with other types of generative models (generative flows and variational autoencoders) and that their efficacy is governed by each model's reliance on local dependencies. In sum, lightweight remedies suffice to achieve robust outlier detection on image data with deep generative models."}}

Ideally, these options can be reused across different higher-level goals; indeed, such reuse is necessary to realize the vision of a continual learning agent that can effectively leverage its prior experience. Previous approaches have only proposed limited forms of transfer of prelearned options to new task settings. We propose a novel option indexing approach to hierarchical learning (OI-HRL), where we learn an affinity function between options and the items present in the environment. This allows us to effectively reuse a large library of pretrained options, in zero-shot generalization at test time, by restricting goal-directed learning to only those options relevant to the task at hand. We develop a meta-training loop that learns the representations of options and environments over a series of HRL problems, by incorporating feedback about the relevance of retrieved options to the higher-level goal. We evaluate OI-HRL in two simulated settings - the CraftWorld and AI2THOR environments - and show that we achieve performance competitive with oracular baselines, and substantial gains over a baseline that has the entire option pool available for learning the hierarchical policy."}}
