While previous methods typically explain a single class in the output, we advocate explaining the whole output, which is a probability distribution over multiple classes. A whole-output explanation can help a human user gain an overall understanding of model behaviour instead of only one aspect of it. It can also provide a natural framework where one can examine the evidence used to discriminate between competing classes, and thereby obtain contrastive explanations. In this paper, we propose a contrastive whole-output explanation (CWOX) method for image classification, and evaluate it using quantitative metrics and through human subject studies. The source code of CWOX is available at https://github.com/vaynexie/CWOX."}}

It is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has attracted much attention in recent years. A large number of approaches have been proposed. Different approaches are motivated from different perspectives, making it difficult to gain an overall understanding of the area. In this paper, we propose a causal framework for domain generalization and present an understanding of common DG approaches in the framework. Our work sheds new lights on the following questions: (1) What are the key ideas behind each DG method? (2) Why is it expected to improve generalization to new domains theoretically? (3) How are different DG methods related to each other and what are relative advantages and limitations? By providing a unified perspective on DG, we hope to help researchers better understand the underlying principles and develop more effective approaches for this critical problem in machine learning."}}

They mostly use attention weights of the [CLS] token on patch embeddings and often produce unsatisfactory saliency maps. This paper proposes a novel method for explaining ViTs called ViT-CX. It is based on patch embeddings, rather than attentions paid to them, and their causal impacts on the model output. Other characteristics of ViTs such as causal overdetermination are considered in the design of ViT-CX. The empirical results show that ViT-CX produces more meaningful saliency maps and does a better job revealing all important evidence for the predictions than previous methods. The explanation generated by ViT-CX also shows significantly better faithfulness to the model. The codes and appendix are available at https://github.com/vaynexie/CausalX-ViT."}}

The same should be true for deep neural networks (DNNs). We use the term example perplexity to refer to the level of difficulty of classifying an example. In this paper, we propose a method to measure the perplexity of an example and investigate what factors contribute to high example perplexity.
