Although some works have been devoted to solving this challenging task, these works either utilize some explicit 3D representations (e.g., mesh), which lack texture and require post-processing for rendering photo-realistic views; or require individual time-consuming optimization for every single case. Here, we make the first attempt to achieve generic text-guided cross-category 3D object generation via a new 3D-TOGO model, which integrates a text-to-views generation module and a views-to-3D generation module. The text-to-views generation module is designed to generate different views of the target 3D object given an input caption. prior-guidance, caption-guidance and view contrastive learning are proposed for achieving better view-consistency and caption similarity. Meanwhile, a pixelNeRF model is adopted for the views-to-3D generation module to obtain the implicit 3D neural representation from the previously-generated views. Our 3D-TOGO model generates 3D objects in the form of the neural radiance field with good texture and requires no time-cost optimization for every single caption. Besides, 3D-TOGO can control the category, color and shape of generated 3D objects with the input caption. Extensive experiments on the largest 3D object dataset (i.e., ABO) are conducted to verify that 3D-TOGO can better generate high-quality 3D objects according to the input captions across 98 different categories, in terms of PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS and CLIP-score, compared with text-NeRF and Dreamfields."}}

However, previous works intend to handle all noisy images in a pre-defined static network architecture, which inevitably leads to high computational complexity for good denoising quality. Here, we present dynamic slimmable denoising network (DDS-Net), a general method to achieve good denoising quality with less computational complexity, via dynamically adjusting the channel configurations of networks at test time with respect to different noisy images. Our DDS-Net is empowered with the ability of dynamic inference by a dynamic gate, which can predictively adjust the channel configuration of networks with negligible extra computation cost. To ensure the performance of each candidate sub-network and the fairness of the dynamic gate, we propose a three-stage optimization scheme. In the first stage, we train a weight-shared slimmable super network. In the second stage, we evaluate the trained slimmable super network in an iterative way and progressively tailor the channel numbers of each layer with minimal denoising quality drop. By a single pass, we can obtain several sub-networks with good performance under different channel configurations. In the last stage, we identify easy and hard samples in an online way and train a dynamic gate to predictively select the corresponding sub-network with respect to different noisy images. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DDS-Net consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art individually trained static denoising networks."}}

Compared with single-robot, the multiple-robot system has much better performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). As a critical component of multiple-robot SLAM, the problem of map merging still remains a challenge. To this end, this article casts it into point set registration problem and proposes an effective map merging method based on the context-based descriptors and correspondence expansion. It first extracts interest points from grid maps by the Harris corner detector. By exploiting neighborhood information of interest points, it automatically calculates the maximum response radius as scale information to compute the context-based descriptor, which includes eigenvalues and normals computed from local structures of each interest point. Then, it effectively establishes origin matches with low precision by applying the nearest neighbor search on the context-based descriptor. Further, it designs a scale-based corresponding expansion strategy to expand each origin match into a set of feature matches, where one similarity transformation between two grid maps can be estimated by the Random Sample Consensus algorithm. Subsequently, a measure function formulated from the trimmed mean square error is utilized to confirm the best similarity transformation and accomplish the coarse map merging. Finally, it utilizes the scaling trimmed iterative closest point algorithm to refine initial similarity transformation so as to achieve accurate merging. As the proposed method considers scale information in the context-based descriptor, it is able to merge grid maps in diverse resolutions. Experimental results on real robot datasets demonstrate its superior performance over other related methods on accuracy and robustness."}}

As the basis of multi-view registration, pair-wise registration is very pivotal. Therefore, we first select a good descriptor and accelerate its correspondence propagation for the pair-wise registration. Then, we design an effective rule to judge the reliability of pair-wise registration results. Subsequently, we propose a model augmentation method, which can utilize reliable results of pair-wise registration to augment the model shape. Finally, multi-view registration can be accomplished by operating the pair-wise registration and judgment, and model augmentation alternately. Experimental results on public available data sets show, that this approach can automatically achieve the multi-view registration of unordered range scans with good accuracy and effectiveness."}}

In real-time applications, efficiency and robustness are more important. To promote these two abilities, we cast the multi-view registration into a clustering task. All the centroids are uniformly sampled from the initially aligned point sets involved in the multi-view registration, which makes it rather efficient and effective for the clustering. Then, each point is assigned to a single cluster and each cluster centroid is updated accordingly. Subsequently, the shape comprised by all cluster centroids is used to sequentially estimate the rigid transformation for each point set. For accuracy and stability, clustering and transformation estimation are alternately and iteratively applied to all point sets. We tested our proposed approach on several benchmark datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results validate its efficiency and robustness for the registration of multi-view point sets."}}

In the large environment, mapping can be significantly accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for map merging from a set of relative motions. Therefore, it firstly adopts the pair-wise map merging method to estimate relative motions for grid map pairs. To obtain as many reliable relative motions as possible, a graph-based sampling scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable relative motions obtained from the pair-wise map merging. Subsequently, the accurate global motions can be recovered from the set of reliable relative motions by the motion averaging. Experimental results carried on real robot data sets demonstrate that proposed approach can achieve simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps with good performances."}}
