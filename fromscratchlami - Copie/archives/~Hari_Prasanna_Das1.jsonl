Individual comfort models, compared to average population responses, can provide the personalization required for successful control. In this work, we frame the thermal preference prediction task as a multivariate, multi-class classification problem and use deep learning and time-series-based approach for thermal preference prediction. We combine l1 regularization with a Regularized Long Short-Term Memory network (R-LSTM) to leverage the attentional mechanisms of such a model while counteracting overfitting. We run experiments on fourteen different subjects and find promising accuracy, F1 and AUC results, outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning approaches applied for the same task."}}

Predicting PTC preferences in a smart home can be a prerequisite to adjusting the indoor temperature for providing a comfortable environment. In this research, we focus on identifying relevant features for predicting PTC preferences. We propose a machine learning-based predictive framework by employing supervised feature selection techniques. We apply two feature selection techniques to select the optimal sets of features to improve the thermal preference prediction performance. The experimental results on a public PTC dataset demonstrated the efficiency of the feature selection techniques that we have applied. In turn, our PTC prediction framework with feature selection techniques achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and area under the curve (AUC), outperforming conventional methods."}}

For machine learning applications in buildings, often the sensor data is augmented with several other artificial variables or metadata corresponding to building components including the occupants. Above datasets are usually organized in the form of a table with rows and columns, and inherently comprise a mix of continuous and discrete (nominal, ordinal) features/columns, thus are called tabular datasets. A vast majority of smart building datasets are tabular in nature. Machine learning algorithms, especially deep neural networks are generally designed as smooth function approximators, and hence are difficult to train optimally with tabular data without appropriate pre-processing. In this work, we analyze the challenges faced by conventional methods for tabular data pre-processing, and propose the use of two improved data transformation methods, namely variational dequantization (for discrete features), and mode-specific normalization (for continuous features). We show improved thermal preference classification performance for two key thermal comfort datasets with the proposed pre-processing. Since the methods are designed in a generalizable way to work for any tabular dataset, we envision them to be an integral part of machine learning algorithm development pipeline for a plethora of smart building applications."}}

This significant amount of energy is used to maintain a comfortable, secure, and productive environment for the occupants. So, it is crucial that the energy consumption in buildings must be optimized, all the while maintaining satisfactory levels of occupant comfort, health, and safety. Recently, Machine Learning has been proven to be an invaluable tool in deriving important insights from data and optimizing various systems. In this work, we review the ways in which machine learning has been leveraged to make buildings smart and energy-efficient. For the convenience of readers, we provide a brief introduction of several machine learning paradigms and the components and functioning of each smart building system we cover. Finally, we discuss challenges faced while implementing machine learning algorithms in smart buildings and provide future avenues for research at the intersection of smart buildings and machine learning."}}

Methods: We present a hybrid model consisting of a conditional generative flow and a classifier for conditional synthetic data generation. The classifier decouples the feature representation for the condition, which is fed to the flow to extract the local noise. We generate synthetic data by manipulating the local noise with fixed conditional feature representation. We also propose a semi-supervised approach to generate synthetic samples in the absence of labels for a majority of the available data. Results: We performed conditional synthetic generation for chest computed tomography (CT) scans corresponding to normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia afflicted patients. We show that our method significantly outperforms existing models both on qualitative and quantitative performance, and our semi-supervised approach can efficiently synthesize conditional samples under label scarcity.

However, in many applications, relevant labeled source datasets may not be available, and collecting source labels can be as expensive as labeling the target data itself. In this paper, we investigate Multi-source Few-shot Domain Adaptation (MFDA): a new domain adaptation scenario with limited multi-source labels and unlabeled target data. As we show, existing methods often fail to learn discriminative features for both source and target domains in the MFDA setting. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, termed Multi-Source Few-shot Adaptation Network (MSFAN), which can be trained end-to-end in a non-adversarial manner. MSFAN operates by first using a type of prototypical, multi-domain, self-supervised learning to learn features that are not only domain-invariant but also class-discriminative. Second, MSFAN uses a small, labeled support set to enforce feature consistency and domain invariance across domains. Finally, prototypes from multiple sources are leveraged to learn better classifiers. Compared with state-of-the-art MDA methods, MSFAN improves the mean classification accuracy over different domain pairs on MFDA by 20.2%, 9.4%, and 16.2% on Office, Office-Home, and DomainNet, respectively."}}

In this work, we propose a transfer learning framework, using Adversarial Domain Adaptation (ADA) to develop personal thermal comfort predictors for target occupants in an unsupervised manner. We also discuss inherent assumptions governing domain adaptation in this application and relevant future works."}}
