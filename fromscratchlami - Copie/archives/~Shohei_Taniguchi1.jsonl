However, its usage is limited in the context of deep latent variable models owing to costly datapoint-wise sampling iterations and slow convergence. This paper proposes the amortized Langevin dynamics (ALD), wherein datapoint-wise MCMC iterations are entirely replaced with updates of an encoder that maps observations into latent variables. This amortization enables efficient posterior sampling without datapoint-wise iterations. Despite its efficiency, we prove that ALD is valid as an MCMC algorithm, whose Markov chain has the target posterior as a stationary distribution under mild assumptions. Based on the ALD, we also present a new deep latent variable model named the Langevin autoencoder (LAE). Interestingly, the LAE can be implemented by slightly modifying the traditional autoencoder. Using multiple synthetic datasets, we first validate that ALD can properly obtain samples from target posteriors. We also evaluate the LAE on the image generation task, and show that our LAE can outperform existing methods based on variational inference, such as the variational autoencoder, and other MCMC-based methods in terms of the test likelihood."}}

However, its usage is limited in the context of deep latent variable models since it is not scalable to data size owing to its datapoint-wise iterations and slow convergence. This paper proposes the amortized Langevin dynamics (ALD), wherein datapoint-wise MCMC iterations are entirely replaced with updates of an inference model that maps observations into latent variables. Since it no longer depends on datapoint-wise iterations, ALD enables scalable inference from large-scale datasets. Despite its efficiency, it retains the excellent property of MCMC; we prove that ALD has the target posterior as a stationary distribution with a mild assumption. Furthermore, ALD can be extended to sampling from an unconditional distribution such as an energy-based model, enabling more flexible generative modeling by applying it to the prior distribution of the latent variable. Based on ALD, we construct a new deep latent variable model named the Langevin autoencoder (LAE). LAE uses ALD for autoencoder-like posterior inference and sampling from the latent space EBM. Using toy datasets, we empirically validate that ALD can properly obtain samples from target distributions in both conditional and unconditional cases, and ALD converges significantly faster than traditional LD. We also evaluate LAE on the image generation task using three datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CelebA-HQ). Not only can LAE be trained faster than non-amortized MCMC methods, but LAE can also generate better samples in terms of the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) compared to AVI-based methods, such as the variational autoencoder."}}

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as Langevin dynamics, provide sample approximations of such posteriors with an asymptotic convergence guarantee. However, it is difficult to apply these methods to large-scale datasets owing to their slow convergence and datapoint-wise iterations. In this study, we propose amortized Langevin dynamics, wherein datapoint-wise MCMC iterations are replaced with updates of an inference model that maps observations into latent variables. The amortization enables scalable inference from large-scale datasets. Developing a latent variable model and an inference model with neural networks, yields Langevin autoencoders (LAEs), a novel Langevin-based framework for deep generative models. Moreover, if we define a latent prior distribution with an unnormalized energy function for more flexible generative modeling, LAEs are extended to a more general framework, which we refer to as contrastive Langevin autoencoders (CLAEs). We experimentally show that LAEs and CLAEs can generate sharp image samples. Moreover, we report their performance of unsupervised anomaly detection."}}
