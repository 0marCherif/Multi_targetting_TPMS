There is an interesting method that uses RNNS (e.g., LSTM, GRU) to update the GCN\u2019s weights dynamically with weights from the previous time step. However, it only uses one time-step weights, which eventually leads to the lack of sufficient historical information. In this work, we focus on this method for the developing parameters and propose a developing GCN model, which adapts an attention mechanism to get richer historical information so that the RNNs will decode better fused historical representations to capture the temporal correlation of weights in the GCN, which not only can learn those dynamic graphs with fewer features, but also can extract richer historical information to learn. We evaluate our method on the task for link prediction and the result shows a better performance in most data sets we test."}}

In comparison, interval-valued data can better represent uncertain information. However, most of the existing theoretical researches on Extended Belief Rule-Based (EBRB) system are aimed at real-valued data and lack methods applied to interval-valued data. Based on the theory of interval evidence reasoning, this paper proposes a new method of constructing and reasoning for interval-valued EBRB systems. This model can not only be applied to interval-valued data but also real-valued data. And after analyzing the problems of the conventional EBRB similarity formula, we use the method of normalized Euclidean distance. In addition, because of the ignorance of attribute weights by conventional methods, this paper combines mutual information methods to determine attribute weights. Some case studies about interval-valued datasets and real-valued datasets are provided in the last. The experimental results have proven the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method."}}

However, as the number of BRB systems participating in ensemble learning increases, a large amount of redundant sub-BRB systems are generated because of the diminishing difference between subsystems. This drastically decreases the prediction speed and increases the storage requirements for BRB systems. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes BRBCS-PAES: a selective ensemble learning approach for BRB Classification Systems (BRBCS) based on Pareto-Archived Evolutionary Strategy (PAES) multi-objective optimization. This system employs the improved Bagging algorithm to train the base classifier. For the purpose of increasing the degree of difference in the integration of the base classifier, the training set is constructed by the repeated sampling of data. In the base classifier selection stage, the trained base classifier is binary coded, and the number of base classifiers participating in integration and generalization error of the base classifier is used as the objective function for multi-objective optimization. Finally, the elite retention strategy and the adaptive mesh algorithm are adopted to produce the PAES optimal solution set. Three experimental studies on classification problems are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the number of base classifiers participating in the integration and improve the accuracy of BRBCS."}}
