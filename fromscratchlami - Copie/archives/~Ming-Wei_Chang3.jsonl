However, it remains unclear whether these models possess the capability to answer questions that are not only querying visual content but knowledge-intensive and information-seeking. In this study, we introduce InfoSeek, a visual question answering dataset tailored for information-seeking questions that cannot be answered with only common sense knowledge. Using InfoSeek, we analyze various pre-trained visual question answering models and gain insights into their characteristics. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g., PaLI-X, BLIP2, etc.) face challenges in answering visual information-seeking questions, but fine-tuning on the InfoSeek dataset elicits models to use fine-grained knowledge that was learned during their pre-training. Furthermore, we show that accurate visual entity recognition can be used to improve performance on InfoSeek by retrieving relevant documents, showing a significant space for improvement."}}

However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity."}}

We compare previously used probability space and distant super-vision assumptions (assumptions on the correspondence between the weak answer string labels and possible answer mention spans). We show that these assumptions interact, and that different configurations provide complementary benefits. We demonstrate that a multi-objective model can efficiently combine the advantages of multiple assumptions and out-perform the best individual formulation. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 4.3 points in F1 on TriviaQA-Wiki and 1.7 points in Rouge-L on NarrativeQA summaries."}}

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)"}}

However, existing image classification benchmarks often evaluate recognition on a specific domain (e.g., outdoor images) or a specific task (e.g., classifying plant species), which falls short of evaluating whether pre-trained foundational models are universal visual recognizers. To address this, we formally present the task of Open-domain Visual Entity recognitioN (OVEN), where a model need to link an image onto a Wikipedia entity with respect to a text query. We construct OVEN-Wiki by re-purposing 14 existing datasets with all labels grounded onto one single label space: Wikipedia entities. OVEN challenges models to select among six million possible Wikipedia entities, making it a general visual recognition benchmark with the largest number of labels. Our study on state-of-the-art pre-trained models reveals large headroom in generalizing to the massive-scale label space. We show that a PaLI-based auto-regressive visual recognition model performs surprisingly well, even on Wikipedia entities that have never been seen during fine-tuning. We also find existing pretrained models yield different strengths: while PaLI-based models obtain higher overall performance, CLIP-based models are better at recognizing tail entities."}}

However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval problems, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To address this, we introduce Prompt-based Query Generation forRetrieval (Promptagator): for each task, we feed the few-shot examples to a large language model (LLM) and prompt it to behave as a task-specific query generator. Using this, we can synthetically generate a large number of relevant queries for any document, yielding abundant data for training task-specific retrievers --- with no reliance on traditional resources such as Natural Questions (Kwiatkowskiet al., 2019) or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016). Surprisingly, Promptagator with only 8 annotated examples enables efficient dual encoder retrievers to outperform computationally more expensive models trained on MS MARCO such as ColBERT v2 (Santhanam et al., 2022) by more than 1.2 points nDCG@10 on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 points nDCG@10 improvement. Our studies show that synthetic query generation can be far more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of task-specific knowledge is given."}}

Given an image (e.g., an image of an aircraft), a text query (`What is the model?' or `What is the airline?'), and a multi-modal knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia),  the goal is to link to an entity  (Boeing-777 or EVA Air) out of all entities in the knowledge base. We build a benchmark dataset (OVEN-wiki), by repurposing 14 existing image classification, image retrieval, and visual QA datasets. We link all existing labels to Wikipedia entities when possible, using a state-of-the-art entity linking system and human annotators, creating a diverse and unified label space. OVEN is a rich and challenging task, which requires models to recognize and link visual content to both a small set of seen entities as well as a much larger set of unseen entities (e.g., unseen aircraft models). OVEN also requires models to generalize to previously unseen intents that may require more fine-grained reasoning (`Who manufactured the aircraft in the back?'). We build strong baselines based on state-of-the-art pre-trained models and find that current pre-trained models struggle to address the challenges posed by OVEN. We hope OVEN will inspire next-generation pre-training techniques and pave the way to future knowledge-intensive vision tasks."}}
