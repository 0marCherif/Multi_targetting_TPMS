In this work, we propose a comparison between three deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM for epileptic seizure detection using EEG data which is the most common technique used for Epilepsy diagnosis. The objective of this work is to define the most suitable model for this sensitive task and to reach the highest possible accuracy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, many experiments are conducted to study the effect of some parameters and using two categorical combinations of an EEG dataset. As a result, we reached a prediction accuracy of 90.26% with CNN, 86.17% with LSTM but the Bi-LSTM model consistently outperformed the other models reaching more than 98% accuracy. Finally, these results demonstrate the possibility of detecting the epileptic seizures while maintaining model interpretability, which may contribute to a better understanding of brain dynamics and enhance predictive performances."}}

In order to get reliable results, all the web giants prioritize investing huge sums of money in these studies. In 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published outstanding achievements in facial recognition technology based on facial biometrics. One recent study estimates that the facial recognition market will be worth 8 billion euros by 2024, with double-digit annual growth rates. The success of biometric recognition has been driven by the advent of neural networks such as deep learning architectures. These learning methods quickly become popular and have offered an interesting solution for realizing intelligent biometric recognition systems. Our work aims to study the use of convolutional neural networks for biometrics recognition based on various biometric traits (such as face, palmprint, and palm vein), and also to design a multi-task learning model for multimodal biometric recognition,"}}

In such systems, the use of biometric data is challenging, namely in the centralized environment. It represents several risks, including information leakage, unreliability, security, privacy, etc. To tackle these issues, several approaches are proposed based on blockchain technology, which has recently gained popularity in various areas. Given the risks related to data security and many others to the technologies involved, it is essential today to have specific protection, particularly for authentication, access control, authorization, secure transfer, traceability, etc. To this end, this project aims to provide secure and intrusion-tolerant intelligent infrastructure and platform, combining the aforementioned technologies to assist and facilitate the daily and professional lives of human beings, respecting their privacy and guaranteeing the security of data and transactions. This research project aims more specifically at cybersecurity based on deep learning through the speech recognition system on the one hand. On the other hand, the ultimate goal is to detect anomalies in the behavior of users once accessing the system. The blockchain will be used to ensure the authentication and identification processes, to deploy the security policy with the smart contract, and also to take care of the generation of the keys necessary for the encryption. The authentication and identification process is done through a combination of voice recognition and user credentials (attributes), using deep learning to extract features and then comparing the template generated with those stored in the blockchain. In addition, our objective is to optimize the voice recognition algorithms. The optimization of such a system requires performance optimization of the platform (i.e., maximization) and risk reduction (i.e., minimization)."}}

In the literature, different solutions have been suggested, and most of them are based on algorithms from optimization and operational research. This paper aims to discuss the application of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly artificial learning, to overcome the limitations of existing work, namely the very limited number of constraints, static planning without auto-updating, reduced size, and application to very specific cases without generalization of the model, and thus improve the performance of existing models and algorithms. For the various use cases, the majority of previous works have only taken into account less difficult restrictions that are specific to certain study instances, but in practice, the situation is different because there are additional more complex constraints and objectives."}}

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common technique\u00a0 used for Epilepsy diagnosis.\u00a0 Generally, it is done by the manual inspection of the EEG recordings of\u00a0 active seizure periods (ictal). Several techniques have been proposed throughout the years to automate this process. In this study, we have developed three different approaches to extract\u00a0 features from the filtered EEG signals. The first approach was to extract eight statistical features directly from the time-domain signal. In the second approach, we have used only the frequency domain information by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to the EEG signals then extracting two statistical features from the lower coefficients. In the last approach, we have used a tool that combines both time and frequency domain\u00a0 information, which is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Six different wavelet families have been tested with\u00a0 their different orders resulting in 37 wavelets. The first three decomposition levels were tested with every wavelet. Instead of feeding the coefficients directly to the classifier, we summarized\u00a0 them in 16 statistical features. The extracted features are then fed to three different classifiers k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to perform two binary classification scenarios: healthy versus epileptic(mainly from interictal activity),and seizure-free versus ictal. We have\u00a0 used a benchmark database, the Bonn database, which consists of five different sets. In the first scenario, we have taken six different combinations of the available data. While in the second scenario, we have taken five combinations. For Epilepsy detection\u00a0 (healthy vs epileptic), the first approach performed badly. Using the DCT improved the results, but the best accuracies were\u00a0 obtained with the DWT-based approach. For seizure detection, the three methods performed quite well. However, the third\u00a0 method had the best performance and was better than many state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. After carrying out\u00a0 the experiments on the whole EEG signal, we separated the five rhythms and applied the DWT on them with the Daubechies7(db7) wavelet for feature extraction. We have observed that close accuracies to those recorded before can be achieved with only the Delta rhythm in the first scenario (Epilepsy detection) and the Beta rhythm in the second scenario\u00a0 (seizure detection)."}}
