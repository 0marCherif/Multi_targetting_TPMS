To improve representation in search results and recommendations, we introduce end-to-end diversification, ensuring that diverse content flows throughout the various stages of these systems, from retrieval to ranking. We develop, experiment, and deploy scalable diversification mechanisms in multiple production surfaces on the Pinterest platform, including Search, Related Products, and New User Homefeed, to improve the representation of different skin tones in beauty and fashion content. Diversification in production systems includes three components: identifying requests that will trigger diversification, ensuring diverse content is retrieved from the large content corpus during the retrieval stage, and finally, balancing the diversity-utility trade-off in a self-adjusting manner in the ranking stage. Our approaches, which evolved from using Strong-OR logical operator to bucketized retrieval at the retrieval stage and from greedy re-rankers to multi-objective optimization using determinantal point processes for the ranking stage, balances diversity and utility while enabling fast iterations and scalable expansion to diversification over multiple dimensions. Our experiments indicate that these approaches significantly improve diversity metrics, with a neutral to a positive impact on utility metrics and improved user satisfaction, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in production."}}

Unfairness occurs when an agent with higher merit obtains a worse outcome than an agent with lower merit. Our central point is that a primary cause of unfairness is uncertainty. A principal or algorithm making decisions never has access to the agents' true merit, and instead uses proxy features that only imperfectly predict merit (e.g., GPA, star ratings, recommendation letters). None of these ever fully capture an agent's merit; yet existing approaches have mostly been defining fairness notions directly based on observed features and outcomes.\n\nOur primary point is that it is more principled to acknowledge and model the uncertainty explicitly. The role of observed features is to give rise to a posterior distribution of the agents' merits. We use this viewpoint to define a notion of approximate fairness in ranking. We call an algorithm $\\phi$-fair (for $\\phi \\in [0,1]$) if it has the following property for all agents $x$ and all $k$: if agent $x$ is among the top $k$ agents with respect to merit with probability at least $\\rho$ (according to the posterior merit distribution), then the algorithm places the agent among the top $k$ agents in its ranking with probability at least $\\phi \\rho$.\n\nWe show how to compute rankings that optimally trade off approximate fairness against utility to the principal. In addition to the theoretical characterization, we present an empirical analysis of the potential impact of the approach in simulation studies. For real-world validation, we applied the approach in the context of a paper recommendation system that we built and fielded at the KDD 2020 conference."}}

In these two-sided markets, not only the users draw utility from the rankings, but the rankings also determine the utility (e.g. exposure, revenue) for the item providers (e.g. publishers, sellers, artists, studios). It has already been noted that myopically optimizing utility to the users, as done by virtually all learning-to-rank algorithms, can be unfair to the item providers. We, therefore, present a learning-to-rank approach for explicitly enforcing merit-based fairness guarantees to groups of items (e.g. articles by the same publisher, tracks by the same artist). In particular, we propose a learning algorithm that ensures notions of amortized group fairness, while simultaneously learning the ranking function from implicit feedback data. The algorithm takes the form of a controller that integrates unbiased estimators for both fairness and utility, dynamically adapting both as more data becomes available. In addition to its rigorous theoretical foundation and convergence guarantees, we find empirically that the algorithm is highly practical and robust."}}

As we have transitioned from finding books in libraries to ranking products, jobs, job applicants, opinions and potential romantic partners, there is a substantial precedent that ranking systems have a responsibility not only to their users but also to the items being ranked. To address these often conflicting responsibilities, we propose a conceptual and computational framework that allows the formulation of fairness constraints on rankings in terms of exposure allocation. As part of this framework, we develop efficient algorithms for finding rankings that maximize the utility for the user while provably satisfying a specifiable notion of fairness. Since fairness goals can be application specific, we show how a broad range of fairness constraints can be implemented using our framework, including forms of demographic parity, disparate treatment, and disparate impact constraints. We illustrate the effect of these constraints by providing empirical results on two ranking problems."}}

Further, we find that evidence from the initial stages of a collaborative activity is just as effective as using the whole."}}
