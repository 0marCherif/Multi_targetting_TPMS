Here, we propose an update to the popular tool DeepLoc with multi-localization prediction and improvements in both performance and interpretability. For training and validation, we curate eukaryotic and human multi-location protein datasets with stringent homology partitioning and enriched with sorting signal information compiled from the literature. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in DeepLoc 2.0 by using a pre-trained protein language model. It has the further advantage that it uses sequence input rather than relying on slower protein profiles. We provide two means of better interpretability: an attention output along the sequence and highly accurate prediction of nine different types of protein sorting signals. We find that the attention output correlates well with the position of sorting signals. The webserver is available at services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?DeepLoc-2.0."}}

We propose a model with a hierarchical char2word encoder, that takes individual characters both as input and output. We first argue that this hierarchical representation of the character encoder reduces computational complexity, and show that it improves translation performance. Secondly, by qualitatively studying attention plots from the decoder we find that the model learns to compress common words into a single embedding whereas rare words, such as names and places, are represented character by character."}}

We demonstrate two approaches to reducing unnecessary computation in cases where a fast but weak baseline classier and a stronger, slower model are both available. Applying an AUC-based metric to the task of sentiment classification, we find significant efficiency gains with both a probability-threshold method for reducing computational cost and one that uses a secondary decision network."}}

We propose a model, inspired by language modeling from natural language processing, with the ability to learn from a collection of undirected molecular graphs, enabling fitting of any underlying structure rule present in the collection. We introduce an adaption to the popular Transformer model, which can learn relationships between atoms and bonds. To our knowledge, the Transformer adaption is the first model that is trained to solve the unsupervised task of recovering partially observed molecules. In this work, we assess how different degrees of information impact performance w.r.t. to fitting the QM9 dataset, which conforms to the octet rule, and to fitting the ZINC dataset, which contains hypervalent molecules and ions requiring the model to learn a more complex structure rule. More specifically, we test a full discrete graph with bond order information, a full discrete graph with only connectivity, a bag-of-neighbors, a bag-of-atoms, and a count-based unigram statistics. These results provide encouraging evidence that neural networks, even when only connectivity is available, can learn arbitrary molecular structure rules specific to a dataset, as the Transformer adaption surpasses a strong octet rule baseline on the ZINC dataset."}}

The NMU is, to our knowledge, the first arithmetic neural network component that can learn to multiply elements from a vector, when the hidden size is large.

The goal of NALU is to learn perfect extrapolation, which requires learning the exact underlying logic of an unknown arithmetic problem. Evaluating the performance of the NALU is non-trivial as one arithmetic problem might have many solutions. As a consequence, single-instance MSE has been used to evaluate and compare performance between models. However, it can be hard to interpret what magnitude of MSE represents a correct solution and models sensitivity to initialization. We propose using a success-criterion to measure if and when a model converges. Using a success-criterion we can summarize success-rate over many initialization seeds and calculate confidence intervals. We contribute a generalized version of the previous arithmetic benchmark to measure models sensitivity under different conditions. This is, to our knowledge, the first extensive evaluation with respect to convergence of the NALU and its sub-units. Using a success-criterion to summarize 4800 experiments we find that consistently learning arithmetic extrapolation is challenging, in particular for multiplication."}}
