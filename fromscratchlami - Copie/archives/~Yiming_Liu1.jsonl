This problem is challenging because video appearance and motion can be highly complex. Traditional optical-flow-based solutions often fail where flow estimation is challenging, while newer neural-network-based methods that hallucinate pixel values directly often produce blurry results. We combine the advantages of these two methods by training a deep network that learns to synthesize video frames by flowing pixel values from existing ones, which we call deep voxel flow. Our method requires no human supervision, and any video can be used as training data by dropping, and then learning to predict, existing frames. The technique is efficient, and can be applied at any video resolution. We demonstrate that our method produces results that both quantitatively and qualitatively improve upon the state-of-the-art."}}

In this paper, we present a real-time textual query-based personal photo retrieval system by leveraging millions of Web images and their associated rich textual descriptions (captions, categories, etc.). After a user provides a textual query (e.g., \"water\u201d), our system exploits the inverted file to automatically find the positive Web images that are related to the textual query \"water\u201d as well as the negative Web images that are irrelevant to the textual query. Based on these automatically retrieved relevant and irrelevant Web images, we employ three simple but effective classification methods, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), decision stumps, and linear SVM, to rank personal photos. To further improve the photo retrieval performance, we propose two relevance feedback methods via cross-domain learning, which effectively utilize both the Web images and personal images. In particular, our proposed cross-domain learning methods can learn robust classifiers with only a very limited amount of labeled personal photos from the user by leveraging the prelearned linear SVM classifiers in real time. We further propose an incremental cross-domain learning method in order to significantly accelerate the relevance feedback process on large consumer photo databases. Extensive experiments on two consumer photo data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system, which is also inherently not limited by any predefined lexicon."}}

However, current LBS tend to be centralized silos with ad-hoc APIs, which limits potential for information sharing and reuse. Further, LBS subscriptions and user experiences are not easily portable across devices. We propose a general architecture for providing open and decentralized access to LBS, based on Tiled Feeds - a RESTful protocol for access and interactions with LBS using feeds, and Feed Subscription Management (FSM) - a generalized feed-based service management protocol. We describe two client designs, and demonstrate how they enable standardized access to LBS services, promote information sharing and mashup creation, and offer service management across various types of location-enabled devices."}}

Using the Internet as a computing platform, many Web 2.0 applications set up mirror sites to provide large-scale availability and to achieve load balance. However, in the age of Web 2.0, where every user is also a writer and publisher, the deployment of mirror sites makes consistency maintenance a Web scale problem. Traditional concurrency control methods (e.g. two phase lock, serialization, etc.) are not up to the task for several reasons. First, large network latency between mirror sites will make two phase locking a throughput bottleneck. Second, locking will block a large portion of concurrent operations, which makes it impossible to provide large-scale availability. On the other hand, most Web 2.0 operations do not need strict serializability - it is not the intention of a user who is correcting a typo in a shared document to block another who is adding a comment, as long as consistency can still be achieved. Thus, in order to enable maximal online collaboration and sharing, we need a lock-free mechanism that can maintain consistency among mirror sites on the Web. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient method to achieve consistency maintenance in the Web 2.0 world. Our experiments show its good performance improvement compared with existing methods based on distributed lock."}}
