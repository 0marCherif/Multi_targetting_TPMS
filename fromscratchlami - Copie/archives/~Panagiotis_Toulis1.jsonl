For instance, in an experiment where we seek to understand the effects of a new ad pricing policy on auction revenue, agents may adapt their bidding in response to the experimental pricing changes. Thus, causal effects of the new pricing policy after such adaptation period, the {\\em long-term causal effects}, are not captured by the classical methodology even though they clearly are more indicative of the value of the new policy. % Here, we formalize a framework to define and estimate long-term causal effects of policy changes in multiagent economies. Central to our approach is behavioral game theory, which we leverage to formulate the ignorability assumptions that are necessary for causal inference. Under such assumptions we estimate long-term causal effects through a latent space approach, where a behavioral model of how agents act conditional on their latent behaviors is combined with a temporal model of how behaviors evolve over time."}}

Initially, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm to implement implicit SGD learning of GLMs. Next, we obtain exact formulas for the bias and variance of both updates which leads to two important observations on their comparative statistical properties. First, in small samples, the estimates from the implicit procedure are more biased than the estimates from the explicit one, but their empirical variance is smaller and they are more robust to learning rate misspecification. Second, the two procedures are statistically identical in the limit: they are both unbiased, converge at the same rate and have the same asymptotic variance. Our set of experiments confirm our theory and more broadly suggest that the implicit procedure can be a competitive choice for fitting large-scale models, especially when robustness is a concern."}}
