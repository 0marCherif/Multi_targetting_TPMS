However, the point clouds captured by the 3D range sensor are commonly sparse and unstructured, challenging efficient segmentation. A fast solution for point cloud instance segmentation with small computational demands is lacking. To this end, we propose a novel fast Euclidean clustering (FEC) algorithm which applies a point-wise scheme over the cluster-wise scheme used in existing works. The proposed method avoids traversing every point constantly in each nested loop, which is time and memory-consuming. Our approach is conceptually simple, easy to implement (40 lines in C++), and achieves two orders of magnitudes faster against the classical segmentation methods while producing high-quality results."}}

This tackles the challenges in the existing works, namely relying on additional sensors, high frame rate video as input, restrictive assumptions on camera motion, readout direction, and poor efficiency. To this end, we first investigate the influence of normalization to the image point on RSBA performance and show its better approximation in modelling the real 6-DoF camera motion. Then we present a novel analytical model for the visual residual covariance, which can be used to standardize the reprojection error during the optimization, consequently improving the overall accuracy. More importantly, the combination of normalization and covariance standardization weighting in RSBA (NW-RSBA) can avoid common planar degeneracy without needing to constrain the filming manner. Besides, we propose an acceleration strategy for NW-RSBA based on the sparsity of its Jacobian matrix and Schur complement. The extensive synthetic and real data experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art works. We also demonstrate the proposed method can be easily implemented and plug-in famous GSSfM and GSSLAM systems as completed RSSfM and RSSLAM solutions."}}

The critical elements of our approach are a robust image feature tracking strategy in dynamic scenes followed by automatic local-window frames slicing, local and global bundle adjustment optimization initialized by a homography-based uncalibrated relative rotation solver. The proposed method allows us to add the virtual objects (elements) into the reconstructed 3D scene, then composite them back into the original shot while perfectly matched perspective and appear seamless.

This extension has never been clearly adressed despite the many roles played by the homography matrix in multi-view geometry. We first show that a direct point-to-point relationship on a RS pair can be expressed as a set of 3 to 8 atomic 3x3 matrices depending on the kinematic model used for the instantaneous-motion during image acquisition. We call this group of matrices the RS Homography. We then propose linear solvers for the computation of these matrices using point correspondences. Finally, we derive linear and closed form solutions for two famous problems in computer vision in the case of RS images: image stitching and plane-based relative pose computation. Extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data from public benchmarks show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-art techniques."}}

Unlike most existing methods which either augment global shutter projection with velocity parameters or impose continuous time and motion through pose interpolation, we use local differential constraints. These are established by drawing analogies with non-rigid 3D vision techniques, namely shape-from-template and non-rigid SfM (NRSfM). The proposed idea is to interpret the images of a rigid surface acquired by a moving RS camera as those of a virtually deformed surface taken by a GS camera. These virtually deformed surfaces are first recovered by relaxing the RS constraint using SfT or NRSfM. Then we upgrade the virtually deformed surface to the actual rigid structure and compute the camera pose and ego-motion by reintroducing the RS constraint. This uses a new 3D-3D registration procedure that minimizes a cost function based on the Euclidean 3D point distance. This is more stable and physically meaningful than the reprojection error or the algebraic distance used in previous work. Experimental results obtained with synthetic and real data show that the proposed methods outperform existing ones in terms of accuracy and stability, even in the known critical configurations."}}

(G\u00e9om\u00e9trie pour la vision 3D avec des cam\u00e9ras Rolling Shutter)", "abstract": "Many modern CMOS cameras are equipped with Rolling Shutter (RS) sensors which are considered as low cost, low consumption and fast cameras. In this acquisition mode, the pixel rows are exposed sequentially from the top to the bottom of the image. Therefore, images captured by moving RS cameras produce distortions (e.g. wobble and skew) which make the classic algorithms at best less precise, at worst unusable due to singularities or degeneracies. The goal of this thesis is to propose a general framework for modelling and solving structure from motion (SfM) with RS cameras. Our approach consists in addressing each sub-task of the SfM pipe-line (namely image correction, absolute and relative pose estimation and bundle adjustment) and proposing improvements.The first part of this manuscript presents a novel RS correction method which uses line features. Unlike existing methods, which uses iterative solutions and make Manhattan World (MW) assumption, our method R4C computes linearly the camera instantaneous-motion using few image features. Besides, the method was integrated into a RANSAC-like framework which enables us to detect curves that correspond to actual 3D straight lines and reject outlier curves making image correction more robust and fully automated.The second part revisits Bundle Adjustment (BA) for RS images. It deals with a limitation of existing RS bundle adjustment methods in case of close read-out directions among RS views which is a common configuration in many real-life applications. In contrast, we propose a novel camera-based RS projection algorithm and incorporate it into RSBA to calculate reprojection errors. We found out that this new algorithm makes SfM survive the degenerate configuration mentioned above.The third part proposes a new RS Homography matrix based on point correspondences from an RS pair. Linear solvers for the computation of this matrix are also presented. Specifically, a practical solver with 13 point correspondences is proposed. In addition, we present two essential applications in computer vision that use RS homography: plane-based RS relative pose estimation and RS image stitching. The last part of this thesis studies absolute camera pose problem (PnP) and SfM which handle RS effects by drawing analogies with non-rigid vision, namely Shape-from-Template (SfT) and Non-rigid SfM (NRSfM) respectively. Unlike all existing methods which perform 3D-2D registration after augmenting the Global Shutter (GS) projection model with the velocity parameters under various kinematic models, we propose to use local differential constraints. The proposed methods outperform stat-of-the-art and handles configurations that are critical for existing methods."}}

This 3D-3D registration involves a 3D cost function based on the Euclidean point distance, more physically meaningful than the re-projection error or the algebraic distance based cost functions used in previous work. Results on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed method outperforms existing RS pose estimation techniques in terms of accuracy and stability of performance in various configurations."}}

We first formulate a parametric equation for the projection of a 3D straight line viewed by a moving rolling shutter camera under a uniform motion model. Then we propose a method which efficiently estimates ego angular velocity separately from pose parameters, using at least 4 image curves. Moreover, we propose for the first time a RANSAC-like strategy to select image curves which really correspond to 3D straight lines and reject those corresponding to actual curves in 3D world. A comparative experimental study with both synthetic and real data from famous benchmarks shows that the proposed method outperforms all the existing techniques from the state-of-the-art."}}

Abstract We propose a 3-step method for structure and motion computation from two or more images taken by a one or multiple moving rolling shutter cameras. This work is motivated by the realization that existing reconstruction methods using rolling shutter images do not give satisfactory results or even fail in many configurations due to singularities and degenerate configurations. The first contribution consists in decoupling the rotate ego motion from the remaining parameters by adding a constraint on image curves basing on the a priori knowledge that they correspond to world 3D straight lines with unknown directions. Straight lines frequently appear in man-made environments such as urban or indoor scenes. After introducing the parameterization of a curve projected from a 3D straight line observed by a moving camera using three rolling shutter projection models, we show how to linearly extract angular velocity of each camera by using detected curves. Then we develop a linear method to recover the translational velocities and the motion between the cameras using point-matches, after compensating effects of angular velocity on each image. The second contribution consists in a novel point based bundle adjustment for rolling shutter cameras (C-RSBA) which does not consider a static row index during structure and motion optimization contrarily to existing methods. This enables to refine the parameters obtained thanks to the straightness constraint by avoiding degenerate configurations, thus outperforming existing RSBA methods. The approach was evaluated on both synthetic and real data."}}
