Many works equipped with deep learning tools, such as MLP, CNN, and transformer, have achieved great improvements in this research field. Point cloud transformer is one of the excellent frameworks for place recognition applied in robotics, but with large memory consumption and expensive computation, it is adverse to widely deploy the various point cloud transformer networks in mobile or embedded devices. To solve this issue, we propose a binary point cloud transformer for place recognition. As a result, a 32-bit full-precision model can be reduced to a 1-bit model with less memory occupation and faster binarized bitwise operations. To our best knowledge, this is the first binary point cloud transformer that can be deployed on mobile devices for online applications such as place recognition. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can get comparable results with the corresponding full-precision transformer model and even outperform some full-precision deep learning methods. For example, the proposed method achieves 93.28% at the top @1% and 85.74% at the top @1% on the Oxford RobotCar dataset in terms of the metric of the average recall rate. Meanwhile, the size and floating point operations of the model with the same transformer structure reduce 56.1% and 34.1% respectively from original precision to binary precision."}}

There is a common assumption in quantization methods from prior works that training data is available. In practice, however, this assumption cannot always be fulfilled due to reasons of privacy and security, rendering these methods inapplicable in real-life situations. Thus, data-free network quantization has recently received significant attention in neural network compression. Causal reasoning provides an intuitive way to model causal relationships to eliminate data-driven correlations, making causality an essential component of analyzing data-free problems. However, causal formulations of data-free quantization are inadequate in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the data generation and discrepancy reduction between the pre-trained and quantized models. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causality-guided Data-free Network Quantization method, Causal-DFQ, to eliminate the reliance on data via approaching an equilibrium of causality-driven intervened distributions. Specifically, we design a content-style-decoupled generator, synthesizing images conditioned on the relevant and irrelevant factors; then we propose a discrepancy reduction loss to align the intervened distributions of the pre-trained and quantized models. It is worth noting that our work is the first attempt towards introducing causality to data-free quantization problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Causal-DFQ.

This issue can be alleviated through quantization. In this paper, we identify that the challenge in quantizing activations in LLMs arises from varying ranges across channels, rather than solely the presence of outliers. To address this challenge, we introduce a quantization method called RPTQ, which utilizes a reorder-based approach. By rearranging the channels and quantizing them in clusters, RPTQ effectively mitigates the impact of range differences between channels. To minimize the overhead of the reorder operation, we fuse it into the layer norm operation and weights in linear layers. In our experiments, RPTQ achieved a significant breakthrough by utilizing 3-bit activation in LLMs for the first time, resulting in a substantial reduction in memory usage. For instance, quantizing OPT-175b can lead to a memory consumption reduction of up to 80%."}}

However, these methods are not preferable in industrial applications because of the model\u2019s large size and the complexity of the training process. In this paper, the difficulty of network specialization is attributed to overfitting caused by a lack of data, and we propose a novel model specialization method by Knowledge Distillation (SKD). The proposed methods merge transfer learning and model compression into one stage. Specifically, we distill and transfer knowledge at the feature map level, circumventing logit-level inconsistency between teacher and student. We empirically investigate and prove the effects of the three parts: Models can be specialized to customer use cases by knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation can effectively regularize the knowledge transfer process to a smaller, task-specific model. Compared with classical methods such as training a model from scratch and model fine-tuning, our methods achieve comparable and much better results and have better training efficiency on the CIFAR-100 dataset for image classification tasks. This paper proves the great potential of model specialization by knowledge distillation."}}

However, the classic task setup rarely considers the challenging, yet common practical situations where the complete visual data may be inaccessible due to various reasons (e.g., restricted view range and occlusions). To this end, we investigate a computer vision task setting with incomplete visual input data. Specifically, we exploit the Scene Graph Generation (SGG) task with various levels of visual data missingness as input. While insufficient visual input intuitively leads to performance drop, we propose to supplement the missing visions via the natural language dialog interactions to better accomplish the task objective. We design a model-agnostic Supplementary Interactive Dialog (SI-Dial) framework that can be jointly learned with most existing models, endowing the current AI systems with the ability of question-answer interactions in natural language. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a task setting with missing visual input and the effectiveness of our proposed dialog module as the supplementary information source through extensive experiments and analysis, by achieving promising performance improvement over multiple baselines."}}

These approaches define a forward diffusion process for transforming data into noise and a backward denoising process for sampling data from noise. Unfortunately, the generation process of current denoising diffusion models is notoriously slow due to the lengthy iterative noise estimations, which rely on cumbersome neural networks. It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed, especially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of diffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories. However, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in every iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of compressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining DMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce post-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output distributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making previous PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step scenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three aspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric. We summarize and use several observations derived from all-inclusive investigations to formulate our method, which especially targets the unique multi-time-step structure of DMs. Experimentally, our method can directly quantize full-precision DMs into 8-bit models while maintaining or even improving their performance in a training-free manner. Importantly, our method can serve as a plug-and-play module on other fast-sampling methods, e.g., DDIM. The code is available at https://github.com/42Shawn/PTQ4DM ."}}
