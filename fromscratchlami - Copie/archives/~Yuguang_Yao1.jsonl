The stealthiness of backdoor attacks has imposed tremendous defense challenges in today's machine learning paradigm. In this paper, we explore the potential of self-training via additional unlabeled data for mitigating backdoor attacks. We begin by making a pilot study to show that vanilla self-training is not effective in backdoor mitigation. Spurred by that, we propose to defend the backdoor attacks by leveraging strong but proper data augmentations in the self-training pseudo-labeling stage. We find that the new self-training regime help in defending against backdoor attacks to a great extent. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments for different backdoor triggers on CIFAR-10 and a combination of CIFAR-10 with an additional unlabeled 500K TinyImages dataset. Finally, we explore the direction of combining self-supervised representation learning with self-training for further improvement in backdoor defense."}}

A ``universal adversarial perturbation'' (UAP) can simultaneously attack multiple images, and thus offers a more unified threat model, obviating an image-wise attack algorithm. However, the existing UAP generator is underdeveloped when images are drawn from different image sources (e.g., with different image resolutions). Towards an authentic universality across image sources, we take a novel view of UAP generation as a customized instance of ``few-shot learning'', which leverages bilevel optimization and learning-to-optimize (L2O) techniques for UAP generation with improved attack success rate (ASR). We begin by considering the popular model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework to meta-learn a UAP generator. However, we see that the MAML framework does not directly offer the universal attack across image sources, requiring us to integrate it with another meta-learning framework of L2O. The resulting scheme for meta-learning a UAP generator (i) has better performance (50% higher ASR) than baselines such as Projected Gradient Descent, (ii) has better performance (37% faster) than the vanilla L2O and MAML frameworks (when applicable), and (iii) is able to simultaneously handle UAP generation for different victim models and data sources."}}

There has been a vast volume of research to generate and defend such adversarial attacks. However, the following problem is left unexplored: How to reverse-engineer adversarial perturbations from an adversarial image? This leads to a new adversarial learning paradigm\u2014Reverse Engineering of Deceptions (RED). If successful, RED allows us to estimate adversarial perturbations and recover the original images. However, carefully crafted, tiny adversarial perturbations are difficult to recover by optimizing a unilateral RED objective. For example, the pure image denoising method may overfit to minimizing the reconstruction error but hardly preserve the classification properties of the true adversarial perturbations. To tackle this challenge, we formalize the RED problem and identify a set of principles crucial to the RED approach design. Particularly, we find that prediction alignment and proper data augmentation (in terms of spatial transformations) are two criteria to achieve a generalizable RED approach. By integrating these RED principles with image denoising, we propose a new Class-Discriminative Denoising based RED framework, termed CDD-RED. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CDD-RED under different evaluation metrics (ranging from the pixel-level, prediction-level to the attribution-level alignment) and a variety of attack generation methods (e.g., FGSM, PGD, CW, AutoAttack, and adaptive attacks)."}}

In this paper, we evaluate how vulnerable such networks are to training-time poisoning attacks for the first time. In contrast to image classification, we find that trigger-embedded basic backdoor attacks on these models executed using heuristics lead to poor attack performance. Thus, it is non-trivial to generate backdoor attacks for image reconstruction. To tackle the problem, we propose a bi-level optimization (BLO)-based attack generation method and investigate its effectiveness on image reconstruction. We show that BLO-generated back-door attacks can yield a significant improvement over the heuristics-based attack strategy."}}
