For long deformable linear objects (DLOs or simply cables) with many (over 25) crossings, we present HANDLOOM (Heterogeneous Autoregressive Learned Deformable Linear Object Observation and Manipulation) a learning-based algorithm that fits a trace to a greyscale image of cables. We evaluate HANDLOOM on semi-planar DLO configurations where each crossing involves at most 2 segments. HANDLOOM makes use of neural networks trained with 30,000 simulated examples and 568 real examples to autoregressively estimate traces of cables and classify crossings. Experiments find that in settings with multiple identical cables, HANDLOOM can trace each cable with 80% accuracy. In single-cable images, HANDLOOM can trace and identify knots with 77% accuracy. When HANDLOOM is incorporated into a bimanual robot system, it enables state-based imitation of knot tying with 80% accuracy, and it successfully untangles 64% of cable configurations across 3 levels of difficulty. Additionally, HANDLOOM demonstrates generalization to knot types and materials (rubber, cloth rope) not present in the training dataset with 85% accuracy.

This work focuses on semi-planar knots, which are knots composed of crossings that each include at most 2 cable segments. We conduct experiments on long cables (3 m in length) with up to 15 semi-planar crossings across 6 different knot types. Crops of crossings from 3 knots (overhand, figure 8, and bowline) of the 6 are seen during training, but none of the full knots are seen during training. This is an improvement from prior work on long cables that can only untangle 2 knot types. Experiments find that in settings with multiple identical cables, TUSK can trace a single cable with 81% accuracy on 7 new knot types. In single-cable images, TUSK can trace and identify the correct knot with 77% success on 3 new knot types. We incorporate TUSK into a bimanual robot system and find that it successfully untangles 64% of cable configurations, including those with new knots unseen during training, across 3 levels of difficulty.

This paper extends prior work on autonomously untangling long cables by introducing novel uncertainty quantification metrics and actions that interact with the cable to reduce perception uncertainty. We present Sliding and Grasping for Tangle Manipulation 2.0 (SGTM 2.0), a system that autonomously untangles cables approximately 3 meters in length with a bilateral robot using estimates of uncertainty at each step to inform actions. By\ninteractively reducing uncertainty, Sliding and Grasping for Tangle Manipulation 2.0 (SGTM 2.0) reduces the number of state-resetting moves it must take, significantly speeding up run-time. Experiments suggest that SGTM 2.0 can achieve 83% untangling success on cables with 1 or 2 overhand and figure-8 knots, and 70% termination detection success across these configurations, outperforming SGTM 1.0 by 43% in untangling accuracy and 200% in full rollout speed.

Real world systems would realistically fail or break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs) and (3) online learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based controllers both guarantee safety and guide the learning process by constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties. Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used, and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous carfollowing with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and show that our algorithm attains much greater sample efficiency in learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms and maintains safety during the entire learning process."}}
