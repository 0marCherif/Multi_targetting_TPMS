Spectral details provide additional information that improves the performance of numerous image based analytic applications, but due to high hyperspectral hardware cost and associated physical constraints, hyperspectral images are not easily available for further processing. Motivated by the success of deep learning for various computer vision applications, we propose a 2D convolution neural network and a 3D convolution neural network based approaches for hyper-spectral image reconstruction from RGB images. A 2D-CNN model primarily focuses on extracting spectral data by considering only spatial correlation of the channels in the image, while in 3D-CNN model the inter-channel co-relation is also exploited to refine the extraction of spectral data. Our 3D-CNN based architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of MRAE and RMSE. In contrast of 3D-CNN, our 2D-CNN based architecture also achieves performance near by state-of-the-art with very less computational complexity."}}

Vision-based activity recognition is among the most popular unobtrusive technique for activity recognition. Caring for the elderly who are living alone from a remote location is one of the biggest challenges of modern human society and is an area of active research. The usage of smart homes with an increasing number of cameras in our daily environment provides the platform to use that technology for activity recognition also. The omnidirectional cameras can be utilized for fall detection activity which minimizes the requirement of multiple cameras for fall detection in an indoor living scenario. Consequently, two vision-based solutions have been proposed: one using convolutional neural networks in 3D-mode and another using a hybrid approach by combining convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks using 360-degree videos for human fall detection. An omnidirectional video dataset has been generated by recording a set of activities performed by different people as no such 360-degree video dataset is available in the public domain for human activity recognition. Both, the models provide fall detection accuracy of more than 90% for omnidirectional videos and can be used for developing a fall detection system for indoor health care."}}

The comparable complexity between human outer ear and face in terms of its uniqueness and permanence has increased interest in the use of ear as a biometric. But similar to face recognition, it poses challenges such as illumination, contrast, rotation, scale, and pose variation. Most of the techniques used for ear biometric authentication are based on traditional image processing techniques or handcrafted ensemble features. Owing to extensive work in the field of computer vision using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), the feasibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the field of ear biometrics has been explored in this research paper. A framework for ear localization and recognition is proposed that aims to reduce the pipeline for a biometric recognition system. The proposed framework uses HOG with support vector machines (SVMs) for ear localization and CNN for ear recognition. CNNs combine feature extraction and ear recognition tasks into one network with an aim to resolve issues such as variations in illumination, contrast, rotation, scale, and pose. The feasibility of the proposed technique has been evaluated on USTB III database. This work demonstrates 97.9% average recognition accuracy using CNNs without any image preprocessing, which shows that the proposed approach is promising in the field of biometric recognition."}}
