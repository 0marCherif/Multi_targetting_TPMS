Pitch contours are commonly used to analyze speech and music signals and as input features for many audio tasks, including music transcription, singing voice synthesis, and prosody editing. In this paper, we describe a set of techniques for improving the accuracy of widely-used neural pitch and periodicity estimators to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both speech and music. We also introduce a novel entropy-based method for extracting periodicity and per-frame voiced-unvoiced classifications from statistical inference-based pitch estimators (e.g., neural networks), and show how to train a neural pitch estimator to simultaneously handle both speech and music data (i.e., cross-domain estimation) without performance degradation. While neural pitch trackers have historically been significantly slower than signal processing based pitch trackers, our estimator implementations approach the speed of state-of-the-art DSP-based pitch estimators on a standard CPU, but with significantly more accurate pitch and periodicity estimation. Our experiments show that an accurate, cross-domain pitch and periodicity estimator written in PyTorch with a hopsize of ten milliseconds can run 11.2x faster than real-time on a Intel i9-9820X 10-core 3.30 GHz CPU or 408x faster than real-time on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, without hardware optimization. We release all of our code and models as Pitch-Estimating Neural Networks (penn), an open-source, pip-installable Python module for training, evaluating, and performing inference with pitch- and periodicity-estimating neural networks. The code for penn is available at https://github.com/interactiveaudiolab/penn."}}

While audio adversarial examples offer one route to mislead or evade these invasive systems, they are typically crafted through time-intensive offline optimization, limiting their usefulness in streaming contexts. Inspired by architectures for audio-to-audio tasks such as denoising and speech enhancement, we propose a neural network model capable of adversarially modifying a user's audio stream in real-time. Our model learns to apply a time-varying finite impulse response (FIR) filter to outgoing audio, allowing for effective and inconspicuous perturbations on a small fixed delay suitable for streaming tasks. We demonstrate our model is highly effective at de-identifying user speech from speaker recognition and able to transfer to an unseen recognition system. We conduct a perceptual study and find that our method produces perturbations significantly less perceptible than baseline anonymization methods, when controlling for effectiveness. Finally, we provide an implementation of our model capable of running in real-time on a single CPU thread. Audio examples and code can be found at https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/project/voiceblock.html."}}

We propose a post-processing model (the Make it Sound Good (MSG) post-processor) to enhance the output of music source separation systems. We apply our post-processing model to state-of-the-art waveform-based and spectrogram-based music source separators, including a separator unseen by MSG during training. Our analysis of the errors produced by source separators shows that waveform models tend to introduce more high-frequency noise, while spectrogram models tend to lose transients and high frequency content. We introduce objective measures to quantify both kinds of errors and show MSG improves the source reconstruction of both kinds of errors. Crowdsourced subjective evaluations demonstrate that human listeners prefer source estimates of bass and drums that have been post-processed by MSG."}}

However, these studies require significant time and cost to perform. As a result, many researchers use objective measures that can correlate poorly with human evaluation. When subjective evaluations are performed, they are often not reported with sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility. We propose Reproducible Subjective Evaluation (ReSEval), an open-source framework for quickly deploying crowdsourced subjective evaluations directly from Python. ReSEval lets researchers launch A/B, ABX, Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) tests on audio, image, text, or video data from a command-line interface or using one line of Python, making it as easy to run as objective evaluation. With ReSEval, researchers can reproduce each other's subjective evaluations by sharing a configuration file and the audio, image, text, or video files."}}

These systems employ deep generative models that model the waveform via either sequential (autoregressive) or parallel (non-autoregressive) sampling. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a common choice for non-autoregressive waveform synthesis. However, state-of-the-art GAN-based models produce artifacts when performing mel-spectrogram inversion. In this paper, we demonstrate that these artifacts correspond with an inability for the generator to learn accurate pitch and periodicity. We show that simple pitch and periodicity conditioning is insufficient for reducing this error relative to using autoregression. We discuss the inductive bias that autoregression provides for learning the relationship between instantaneous frequency and phase, and show that this inductive bias holds even when autoregressively sampling large chunks of the waveform during each forward pass. Relative to prior state-of-the-art GAN-based models, our proposed model, Chunked Autoregressive GAN (CARGAN) reduces pitch error by 40-60%, reduces training time by 58%, maintains a fast inference speed suitable for real-time or interactive applications, and maintains or improves subjective quality."}}

Thus far, methods for pitch-shifting and time-stretching that use digital signal processing (DSP) have been favored over deep learning approaches due to their speed and relatively higher quality. However, even existing DSP-based methods for pitch-shifting and time-stretching induce artifacts that degrade audio quality. In this paper, we propose Controllable LPCNet (CLPCNet), an improved LPCNet vocoder capable of pitch-shifting and time-stretching of speech. For objective evaluation, we show that CLPCNet performs pitch-shifting of speech on unseen datasets with high accuracy relative to prior neural methods. For subjective evaluation, we demonstrate that the quality and naturalness of pitch-shifting and time-stretching with CLPCNet on unseen datasets meets or exceeds competitive neural- or DSP-based approaches."}}

A major drawback of current systems, however, is that edited recordings often sound unnatural because of prosody mismatches around edited regions. In our work, we propose a new context-aware method for more natural sounding text-based editing of speech. To do so, we 1) use a series of neural networks to generate salient prosody features that are dependent on the prosody of speech surrounding the edit and amenable to fine-grained user control 2) use the generated features to control a standard pitch-shift and time-stretch method and 3) apply a denoising neural network to remove artifacts induced by the signal manipulation to yield a high-fidelity result. We evaluate our approach using a subjective listening test, provide a detailed comparative analysis, and conclude several interesting insights."}}

However, these systems lack intuitive user controls over prosody, making them unable to rectify prosody errors (e.g., misplaced emphases and contextually inappropriate emotions) or generate prosodies with diverse speaker excitement levels and emotions. We address these limitations with a user-controllable, context-aware neural prosody generator. Given a real or synthesized speech recording, our model allows a user to input prosody constraints for certain time frames and generates the remaining time frames from input text and contextual prosody. We also propose a pitch-shifting neural vocoder to modify input speech to match the synthesized prosody. Through objective and subjective evaluations we show that we can successfully incorporate user control into our prosody generation model without sacrificing the overall naturalness of the synthesized speech."}}
