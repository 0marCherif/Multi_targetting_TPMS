We use collections of real world images without bounding box annotations to learn to synthesize and detect objects. We leverage controllable GANs to synthesize images with pre-defined object properties and use them to train object detectors. We propose a tight end-to-end coupling of the synthesis and detection networks to optimally train our system. Finally, we also propose a method to optimally adapt SSOD to an intended target data without requiring labels for it. For the task of car detection, on the challenging KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, we show that SSOD outperforms the prior state-of-the-art purely image-based self-supervised object detection method Wetectron. Even without requiring any 3D CAD assets, it also surpasses the state-of-the-art rendering based method Meta-Sim2. Our work advances the field of self-supervised object detection by introducing a successful new paradigm of using controllable GAN-based image synthesis for it and by significantly improving the baseline accuracy of the task.

Existing methods require accurate motion capture data for training, which is costly to obtain. Instead, we propose a framework for training generative models of physically plausible human motion directly from monocular RGB videos, which are much more widely available. At the core of our method is a novel optimization formulation that corrects imperfect image-based pose estimations by enforcing physics constraints and reasons about contacts in a differentiable way. This optimization yields corrected 3D poses and motions, as well as their corresponding contact forces. Results show that our physically-corrected motions significantly outperform prior work on pose estimation. We can then use these to train a generative model to synthesize future motion. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively improved motion estimation, synthesis quality and physical plausibility achieved by our method on the Human3.6m dataset~\\cite{h36m_pami} as compared to prior kinematic and physics-based methods. By enabling learning of motion synthesis from video, our method paves the way for large-scale, realistic and diverse motion synthesis."}}

Additionally, in contrast to prior work, our approach reconstructs human meshes in consistent global coordinates even with dynamic cameras. Since the joint reconstruction of human motions and camera poses is underconstrained, we propose a global trajectory predictor that generates global human trajectories based on local body movements. Using the predicted trajectories as anchors, we present a global optimization framework that refines the predicted trajectories and optimizes the camera poses to match the video evidence such as 2D keypoints.

We observe that 3D points that are static relative to one another should belong to the same part, and that adjacent parts that move relative to each other must be connected by a joint. To leverage this insight, we model the object parts in 3D as ellipsoids, which allows us to identify joints.

Exhaustively covering this wide range of factors in fully annotated datasets has remained impractical, posing significant challenges for generalization of supervised methods. Embracing this challenge, we propose to combine ideas from adversarial training and motion modelling to tap into unlabeled videos. To this end we propose what to the best of our knowledge is the first motion model for hands and show that an adversarial formulation leads to better generalization properties of the hand pose estimator via semi-supervised training on unlabeled video sequences. In this setting, the pose predictor must produce a valid sequence of hand poses, as determined by a discriminative adversary. This adversary reasons both on the structural as well as temporal domain, effectively exploiting the spatio-temporal structure in the task. The main advantage of our approach is that we can make use of unpaired videos and joint sequence data both of which are much easier to attain than paired training data. We perform extensive evaluation, investigating essential components needed for the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate in two challenging settings that the proposed approach leads to significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy. In the lowest label setting, we attain an improvement of $40\\%$ in absolute mean joint error."}}
