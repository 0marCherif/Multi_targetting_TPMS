First, we reveal that a recent bit allocation approach claimed to be optimal is, in fact, sub-optimal due to its implementation. Specifically, we find that its sub-optimality lies in the improper application of semi-amortized variational inference (SAVI) on latent with non-factorized variational posterior. Then, we show that the corrected version of SAVI on non-factorized latent requires recursively applying back-propagating through gradient ascent, based on which we derive the corrected optimal bit allocation algorithm. Due to the computational in-feasibility of the corrected bit allocation, we design an efficient approximation to make it practical. Empirical results show that our proposed correction significantly improves the incorrect bit allocation in terms of R-D performance and bitrate error, and outperforms all other bit allocation methods by a large margin. The source code is provided in the supplementary material."}}

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods adopt uniform posterior to approximate quantization noise, and single-sample pathwise estimator to approximate the gradient of evidence lower bound (ELBO). In this paper, we propose to train NIC with multiple-sample importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE) target, which is tighter than ELBO and converges to log likelihood as sample size increases. First, we identify that the uniform posterior of NIC has special properties, which affect the variance and bias of pathwise and score function estimators of the IWAE target. Moreover, we provide insights on a commonly adopted trick in NIC from gradient variance perspective. Based on those analysis, we further propose multiple-sample NIC (MS-NIC), an enhanced IWAE target for NIC. Experimental results demonstrate that it improves SOTA NIC methods. Our MS-NIC is plug-and-play, and can be easily extended to neural video compression.\n"}}

However, it usually requires a dedicated encoder-decoder pair for each point on R-D curve, which greatly hinders its practical deployment. While some recent works have enabled bitrate control via conditional coding, they impose strong prior during training and provide limited flexibility. In this paper we propose Code Editing, a highly flexible coding method for NIC based on semi-amortized inference and adaptive quantization. Our work is a new paradigm for variable bitrate NIC, and experimental results show that our method surpasses existing variable-rate methods. Furthermore, our approach is so flexible that it can also achieves ROI coding and multi-distortion trade-off with a single decoder. Our approach is compatible to all NIC methods with differentiable decoder NIC, and it can be even directly adopted on existing pre-trained models."}}

The recent LIC methods outperform VVC in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. However, the low bit-rate reconstructions of LIC suffer from artifacts such as blurring, color drifting and texture missing. Moreover, those varied artifacts make image quality metrics correlate badly with human perceptual quality. In this paper, we propose PO-ELIC, i.e., Perception-Oriented Efficient Learned Image Coding. To be specific, we adapt ELIC, one of the state-of-the-art LIC models, with adversarial training techniques. We apply a mixture of losses including hinge-form adversarial loss, Charbonnier loss, and style loss, to finetune the model towards better perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable perceptual quality with HiFiC with much lower bitrate."}}

However, manual segmentation of the BV and body requires substantial time and expertise. This work proposes a novel deep learning based end-to-end auto-context refinement framework, consisting of two stages. The first stage produces a low resolution segmentation of the BV and body simultaneously. The resulting probability map for each object (BV or body) is then used to crop a region of interest (ROI) around the target object in both the original image and the probability map to provide context to the refinement segmentation network. Joint training of the two stages provides significant improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) over using only the first stage (0.818 to 0.906 for the BV, and 0.919 to 0.934 for the body). The proposed method significantly reduces the inference time (102.36 to 0.09 s/volume \u22481000x faster) while slightly improves the segmentation accuracy over the previous methods using slide-window approaches."}}
