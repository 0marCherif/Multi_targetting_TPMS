Recently, great advances have been made in searching for optimal augmentation policies in the image classification domain. However, two key points related to data augmentation remain uncovered by the current methods. First is that most if not all modern augmentation search methods are offline and learning policies are isolated from their usage. The learned policies are mostly constant throughout the training process and are not adapted to the current training model state. Second, the policies rely on class-preserving image processing functions. Hence applying current offline methods to new tasks may require domain knowledge to specify such kind of operations. In this work, we offer an orthogonal online data augmentation scheme together with three new augmentation networks, co-trained with the target learning task. It is both more efficient, in the sense that it does not require expensive offline training when entering a new domain, and more adaptive as it adapts to the learner state. Our augmentation networks require less domain knowledge and are easily applicable to new tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme alone performs on par with the state-of-the-art offline data augmentation methods, as well as improving upon the state-of-the-art in combination with those methods."}}

However, the robustness of such foundation models against distribution shifts is crucial in downstream applications.  In this paper, we investigate their robustness under image and text perturbations. We first build several multimodal benchmark datasets by applying 17 image perturbation and 16 text perturbation techniques. Then we extensively study the robustness of 6 widely adopted models on 3 downstream tasks (image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, and visual entailment). We observe that these powerful multimodal models are sensitive to image/text perturbations, especially to image perturbations. For text, character-level perturbations have shown higher adversarial impact than word-level and sentence-level perturbations.  We also observe that models trained by generative objectives tend to be more robust. Our findings in terms of robustness study could facilitate the development of large image-text models, as well as their deployment for real-world applications."}}

We propose a simple recipe called data-efficient prompt tuning (DePT) with two key ingredients. First, DePT plugs visual prompts into the vision Transformer and only tunes these source-initialized prompts during adaptation. We find such parameter-efficient finetuning can efficiently adapt the model representation to the target domain without overfitting to the noise in the learning objective. Second, DePT bootstraps the source representation to the target domain by memory bank-based online pseudo labeling. A hierarchical self-supervised regularization specially designed for prompts is jointly optimized to alleviate error accumulation during self-training. With much fewer tunable parameters, DePT demonstrates not only state-of-the-art performance on major adaptation benchmarks, but also superior data efficiency, i.e., adaptation with only 1\\% or 10\\% data without much performance degradation compared to 100\\% data. In addition, DePT is also versatile to be extended to online or multi-source TTA settings."}}

In this paper, we investigate the robustness of 9 popular open-sourced image-text models under common perturbations on five tasks (image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, visual entailment, image captioning, and text-to-image generation). In particular, we propose several new multimodal robustness benchmarks by applying 17 image perturbation and 16 text perturbation techniques on top of existing datasets. We observe that multimodal models are not robust to image and text perturbations, especially to image perturbations. Among the tested perturbation methods, character-level perturbations constitute the most severe distribution shift for text, and zoom blur is the most severe shift for image data. We also introduce two new robustness metrics (MMI and MOR) for proper evaluations of multimodal models. We hope our extensive study sheds light on new directions for the development of robust multimodal models."}}

In medical image analysis, a well-designed augmentation policy usually requires much expert knowledge and is difficult to generalize to multiple tasks due to the vast discrepancies among pixel intensities, image appearances, and object shapes in different medical tasks. To automate medical data augmentation, we propose a regularized adversarial training framework via two min-max objectives and three differentiable augmentation models covering affine transformation, deformation, and appearance changes. Our method is more automatic and efficient than previous automatic augmentation methods, which still rely on pre-defined operations with human-specified ranges and costly bi-level optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach, with less training overhead, achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art auto-augmentation methods on both tasks of 2D skin cancer classification and 3D organs-at-risk segmentation."}}
