We build a generative environment model for the structural relationships among variables in the system and present a principled way to characterize ASRs based on structural constraints and the goal of maximizing cumulative reward in policy learning. We then develop a structured sequential Variational Auto-Encoder to estimate the environment model and extract ASRs. Our empirical results on CarRacing and VizDoom demonstrate a clear advantage of learning and using ASRs for policy learning.

Nevertheless, proposed algorithms for powering recommender systems seldom model these dynamics, instead proceeding as though user preferences were fixed in time. In this work, we introduce rebounding bandits, a multi-armed bandit setup, where satiation dynamics are modeled as time-invariant linear dynamical systems. Expected rewards for each arm decline monotonically with consecutive exposures and rebound towards the initial reward whenever that arm is not pulled. Unlike classical bandit algorithms, methods for tackling rebounding bandits must plan ahead and model-based methods rely on estimating the parameters of the satiation dynamics. We characterize the planning problem, showing that the greedy policy is optimal when the arms exhibit identical deterministic dynamics. To address stochastic satiation dynamics with unknown parameters, we propose Explore-Estimate-Plan, an algorithm that pulls arms methodically, estimates the system dynamics, and then plans accordingly."}}

However, while the bandits literature has adopted a diverse set of objectives, most research on off-policy evaluation to date focuses on the expected reward. In this paper, we introduce Lipschitz risk functionals, a broad class of objectives that subsumes conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), variance, mean-variance, many distorted risks, and CPT risks, among others. We propose Off-Policy Risk Assessment (OPRA), a framework that first estimates a target policy's CDF and then generates plugin estimates for any collection of Lipschitz risks, providing finite sample guarantees that hold simultaneously over the entire class. We instantiate OPRA with both importance sampling and doubly robust estimators. Our primary theoretical contributions are (i) the first uniform concentration inequalities for both CDF estimators in contextual bandits and (ii) error bounds on our Lipschitz risk estimates, which all converge at a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$."}}

It is common to aim to maximize the mean outcome in the population, via a regime assigning treatment only to those whose mean outcome is higher under treatment versus control. However, the mean can be an unstable measure of centrality, resulting in imprecise statistical procedures, as well as unrobust decisions that can be overly influenced by a small fraction of subjects. In this work, we propose a new median optimal treatment regime that instead treats individuals whose conditional median is higher under treatment. This ensures that optimal decisions for individuals from the same group are not overly influenced either by (i) a small fraction of the group (unlike the mean criterion), or (ii) unrelated subjects from different groups (unlike marginal median/quantile criteria). We introduce a new measure of value, the Average Conditional Median Effect (ACME), which summarizes across-group median treatment outcomes of a policy, and which the median optimal treatment regime maximizes. After developing key motivating examples that distinguish median optimal treatment regimes from mean and marginal median optimal treatment regimes, we give a nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating the ACME of a policy, and propose a new doubly robust-style estimator that achieves the efficiency bound under weak conditions. To construct the median optimal treatment regime, we introduce a new doubly robust-style estimator for the conditional median treatment effect. Finite-sample properties are explored via numerical simulations and the proposed algorithm is illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial in patients with HIV."}}

Because optimizing the coherent risk is difficult in Markov decision processes, recent work tends to focus on the Markov coherent risk (MCR), a time-consistent surrogate. While, policy gradient (PG) updates have been derived for this objective, it remains unclear (i) whether PG finds a global optimum for MCR; (ii) how to estimate the gradient in a tractable manner. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in general, MCR objectives (unlike the expected return) are not gradient dominated and that stationary points are not, in general, guaranteed to be globally optimal. Moreover, we present a tight upper bound on the suboptimality of the learned policy, characterizing its dependence on the nonlinearity of the objective and the degree of risk aversion. Addressing (ii), we propose a practical implementation of PG that uses state distribution reweighting to overcome previous limitations. Through experiments, we demonstrate that when the optimality gap is small, PG can learn risk-sensitive policies. However, we find that instances with large suboptimality gaps are abundant and easy to construct, outlining an important challenge for future research."}}
