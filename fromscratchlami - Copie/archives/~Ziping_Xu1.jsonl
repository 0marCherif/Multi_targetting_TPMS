An off-policy learning algorithm MOPA based on recurrent models is then proposed to solve the ET-MDP, which thereby solves the corresponding CMDP.

Performance of such an approach can be significantly limited by the quality of the perception model in the low labeled data regime. We propose a novel iterative framework that simultaneously couples and improves the training of both RL and the perception model. The perception model takes pseudo labels generated from the trajectories of a trained RL agent believing that the decision-model can correct errors made by the perception model. We apply the framework to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data collection, whose goal is to find as many high-quality micrographs taken by cryo-electron microscopy as possible by navigating at different magnification levels. Our proposed method significantly outperforms various baseline methods in terms of both RL rewards and the accuracy of the perception model. We further provide some theoretical insights into the benefits of coupling the decision model and the perception model by showing that RL-generated pseudo labels are biased towards localization which aligns with the underlying data generating mechanism. Our iterative framework that couples both sides of the semi-supervised RL can be applied to a wide range of sequential decision-making tasks when the labeled data is \nlimited."}}

Starting with a large unlabeled dataset, algorithms for ASD adaptively label the points with the goal to maximize the sum of responses.\n\nThis problem has wide applications to real-world discovery problems, for example drug discovery with the help of machine learning models. ASD algorithms face the well-known exploration-exploitation dilemma. The algorithm needs to choose points that yield information to improve model estimates but it also needs to exploit the model. We rigorously formulate the problem and propose a general information-directed sampling (IDS) algorithm. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of IDS in linear, graph and low-rank models. The benefits of IDS are shown in both simulation experiments and real-data experiments for discovering chemical reaction conditions."}}

Most of these papers assume that the function mapping shared representations to predictions is linear, for both source and target tasks. In practice, researchers in deep learning use different numbers of extra layers following the pretrained model based on the difficulty of the new task. This motivates us to ask whether diversity can be achieved when source tasks and the target task use different prediction function spaces beyond linear functions. We show that diversity holds even if the target task uses a neural network with multiple layers, as long as source tasks use linear functions. If source tasks use nonlinear prediction functions, we provide a negative result by showing that depth-1 neural networks with ReLu activation function need exponentially many source tasks to achieve diversity. For a general function class, we find that eluder dimension gives a lower bound on the number of tasks required for diversity. Our theoretical results imply that simpler tasks generalize better. Though our theoretical results are shown for the global minimizer of empirical risks, their qualitative predictions still hold true for gradient-based optimization algorithms as verified by our simulations on deep neural networks."}}

Funnel structure, a well-known concept in the marketing field, occurs in those systems where the decision maker interacts with the environment in a layered manner receiving far fewer observations from deep layers than shallow ones. For example, in the email marketing campaign application, the layers correspond to Open, Click and Purchase events. Conversions from Click to Purchase happen very infrequently because a purchase cannot be made unless the link in an email is clicked on. We formulate this challenging decision making problem as a contextual bandit with funnel structure and develop a multi-task learning algorithm that mitigates the lack of sufficient observations from deeper layers. We analyze both the prediction error and the regret of our algorithms. We verify our theory on prediction errors through a simple simulation. Experiments on both a simulated environment and an environment based on real-world data from a major email marketing company show that our algorithms offer significant improvement over previous methods."}}

Experiments show that ZOSPI achieves competitive results on the MuJoCo benchmarks with a remarkable sample efficiency. Moreover, different from the conventional policy gradient methods, the policy learning of ZOSPI is conducted in a self-supervised manner. We show such a self-supervised learning paradigm has the flexibility of including optimistic exploration as well as adopting a non-parametric policy."}}
