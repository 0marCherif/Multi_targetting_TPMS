A range of hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration methods have been developed, yet their effectiveness in enhancing low-light HSIs is constrained. This work focuses on the low-light HSI enhancement task, which aims to reveal the spatial\u2013spectral information hidden in darkened areas. To facilitate the development of low-light HSI processing, we collect an LHSI dataset of both indoor and outdoor scenes. Based on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, we developed an end-to-end data-driven low-light HSI enhancement (HSIE) approach trained on the LHSI dataset. With the observation that illumination is related to the low-frequency component of HSI, while textural details are closely correlated with the high-frequency component, the proposed HSIE is designed to have two branches. The illumination enhancement branch is adopted to enlighten the low-frequency component with reduced resolution. The high-frequency refinement branch is utilized for refining the high-frequency component via a predicted mask. In addition, to improve information flow and boost performance, we introduce an effective channel attention block (CAB) with residual dense connection, which served as the basic block of the illumination enhancement branch. The effectiveness and efficiency of HSIE both in quantitative assessment measures and visual effects are demonstrated by experimental results on the LHSI dataset. According to the classification performance on the remote-sensing Indian Pines dataset, downstream tasks benefit from the enhanced HSI.
