Building on the success of deep learning with prototypes in Euclidean and hyperspherical spaces, a few recent works have proposed hyperbolic prototypes for classification. Such approaches enable effective learning in low-dimensional output spaces and can exploit hierarchical relations amongst classes, but require privileged information about class labels to position the hyperbolic prototypes. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Busemann Learning. The main idea behind our approach is to position prototypes on the ideal boundary of the Poincar\\'{e} ball, which does not require prior label knowledge. To be able to compute proximities to ideal prototypes, we introduce the penalised Busemann loss. We provide theory supporting the use of ideal prototypes and the proposed loss by proving its equivalence to logistic regression in the one-dimensional case. Empirically, we show that our approach provides a natural interpretation of classification confidence, while outperforming recent hyperspherical and hyperbolic prototype approaches."}}

Since these photos are taken in unconstrained settings, recognizing the identities of people among the photos remains a challenge. Studies have indicated that utilizing evidence other than face appearance improves the performance of person recognition systems. In this work, we aim to take advantage of additional cues obtained from different body regions in a zooming in fashion for person recognition. Hence, we present Zoom-RNN, a novel method based on recurrent neural networks for combining evidence extracted from the whole body, upper body, and head regions. Our model is evaluated on a challenging dataset, namely People In Photo Albums (PIPA), and we demonstrate that employing our system improves the performance of conventional fusion methods by a noticeable margin."}}

Streams of CNNs are separately trained on different modalities and their predictions are fused at the end. Each stream has two branches to predict the group activity based on person and scene level representations. A new modality based on the human pose estimation is presented to add extra information to the model. We evaluate our method on the Volleyball and Collective Activity datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to achieve state-of-the-art results when multiple or single frames are given as input to the model with 90.50% and 86.61% accuracy on Volleyball dataset, respectively, and 87.01% accuracy of multiple frames group activity on Collective Activity dataset."}}
