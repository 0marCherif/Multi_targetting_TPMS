However, as we move towards a decentralized Web 3.0 enabled smart city, we can utilize cutting edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and many more to reduce food waste in different phases of the supply chain. In this paper, we propose SmartNoshWaste\u2014a blockchain based multi-layered framework utilizing cloud computing, QR code and reinforcement learning to reduce food waste. We also evaluate SmartNoshWaste on real world food data collected from the nosh app to show the efficacy of the proposed framework and we are able to reduce food waste by 9.46% in comparison to the originally collected food data based on the experimental evaluation."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) on CPU, GPU and RAM in a mobile MPSoC, which caters to the performance requirements of the executing application while consuming low power. We evaluate our methodology on a real hardware platform, Odroid XU4, and the experimental results prove the approach to be 26% more power-efficient and 21% more thermal-efficient compared to the state-of-the-art system."}}

Approaches to balance instantaneous power consumption, performance and QoE have been reported, but little research has considered how to perform longer-term budgeting of resources across a complete battery discharge cycle. Approaches that have considered this are oblivious to the daily variability in the user\u2019s desired charging time-of-day (plug-in time), resulting in a failure to meet the user\u2019s battery life expectations, or else an unnecessarily over-constrained QoE. This paper proposes QUAREM, an adaptive resource management approach in mobile MPSoC platforms that maximises QoE while meeting battery life expectations. The proposed approach utilises a model that learns and then predicts the dynamics of the energy usage pattern and plug-in times. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches, we maximise the QoE through the adaptive balancing of the battery life and the quality of service (QoS) for the duration of the battery discharge. Our model achieves a good degree of accuracy with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.47% and 2.48% for the energy demand and plug-in times, respectively. Experimental evaluation on an off-the-shelf commercial smartphone shows that QUAREM achieves the expected battery life of the user within 20\u201325% energy demand variation with little or no QoE degradation."}}

Machine learning has proven to be effective in learning heuristics based resource mapping approaches, but its success is bound by the quality of feature extraction. Additionally, feature extraction in such approaches not just requires expert domain knowledge and human effort, but at the same time requires the application (tasks) to be profiled for such processes. Therefore, the efficacy of such resource mapping methodologies depends on expertise, skills, profiling time and architecture of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, Asynchronous Hybrid Deep Learning (AHDL), which sets a new paradigm of using Deep Learning approaches to map resources to application (tasks). In our approach, we leverage task profiling methodologies to achieve accurate mapping in order to achieve greater reward from the system, but at the same time is able to allocate resources to unprofiled application (tasks) at the same time without the need of manual feature extraction by domain experts. Our proposed methodology is able to achieve competitive results in comparison with the state-of- the-art without the usual associated challenges such as manual feature extraction."}}

This proposed technique, SD-AEI, is very effective in encrypting any type of images and the results were very satisfactory. SD-AEI method is also compared with various other image encryption techniques and it was found that SD-AEI cryptographic method takes optimal amount of time when compared to other encryption techniques, for encrypting and decrypting an image file. This method can be used to encrypt any type of image file, especially secret images, where steganography has been applied, so that the contents in the image file can be kept more secure."}}
