Adversarial imitation learning (AIL), a subset of IL methods, is particularly promising, but its theoretical foundation in the presence of unknown transitions has yet to be fully developed. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of AIL in this context, where the stochastic and uncertain nature of environment transitions presents a challenge.  We examine the expert sample complexity and interaction complexity required to recover good policies. To this end, we establish a framework connecting reward-free exploration and AIL, and propose an algorithm, MB-TAIL, that achieves the minimax optimal expert sample complexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (H^{3/2} |\\mathcal{S}|/\\varepsilon)$ and interaction complexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (H^{3} |\\mathcal{S}|^2 |\\mathcal{A}|/\\varepsilon^2)$. Here, $H$ represents the planning horizon, $|\\gS|$ is the state space size, $|\\gA|$ is the action space size, and $\\varepsilon$ is the desired imitation gap. MB-TAIL is the first algorithm to achieve this level of expert sample complexity in the unknown transition setting and improves upon the interaction complexity of the best-known algorithm, OAL, by $\\gO (H)$. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of MB-TAIL by extending it to the function approximation setting and proving that it can achieve expert sample and interaction complexity independent of $|\\gS|$."}}

Prior works mainly concentrate on the policy change cross episodes, ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from sudden policy change within an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance. We formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some agents to coordinate with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be changed within one episode. Then we develop a new framework Fast teammates adaptation (Fastap) to address the problem. Concretely, we first train versatile teammates' policies and assign them to different clusters via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to coordinate with the sampled uncontrolled teammates by capturing their identifications as context for fast adaptation. Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates' context for decision-making accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a robust policy that can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution phase. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior performance than multiple baselines in stationary and non-stationary scenarios. "}}

An active research topic on this problem is ad hoc teamwork, which improves agents' coordination ability in zero-shot settings. However, previous works can only solve the problem of a single agent's coordination with different teams, which is not in line with arbitrary group-to-group coordination in complex multi-agent scenarios. Moreover, they commonly suffer from limited adaptation ability within an episode in a zero-shot setting. To address these problems, we introduce the Coordination Scheme Probing (CSP) approach that applies a disentangled scheme probing module to represent and classify the newly arrived teammates beforehand with limited pre-collected episodic data and makes multi-agent control accordingly. To achieve generalization, CSP learns a meta-policy with multiple sub-policies that follow distinguished coordination schemes in an end-to-end fashion and automatically reuses it to coordinate with unseen teammates. Empirically, we show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance compared to existing ad hoc teamwork and policy generalization methods in various multi-agent cooperative scenarios."}}

Previous multi-task MARL approaches require costly interactions to simultaneously learn or fine-tune policies in different tasks. However, the situation that an agent should generalize to multiple tasks with only offline data from limited tasks is more in line with the needs of real-world applications. Since offline multi-task data contains a variety of behaviors, an effective data-driven approach is to extract informative latent variables that can represent universal skills for realizing coordination across tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Offline MARL algorithm to Discover coordInation Skills (ODIS) from multi-task data. ODIS first extracts task-invariant coordination skills from offline multi-task data and learns to delineate different agent behaviors with the discovered coordination skills. Then we train a coordination policy to choose optimal coordination skills with the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. We further demonstrate that the discovered coordination skills can assign effective coordinative behaviors, thus significantly enhancing generalization to unseen tasks. Empirical results in cooperative MARL benchmarks, including the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, show that ODIS obtains superior performance in a wide range of tasks only with offline data from limited sources."}}

In the cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning field, which has also shown potential in real-life domains, little work focuses on the problem of adversarial attacks. However, adversarial attacks on observations that can undermine the coordination among agents are likely to occur in actual deployment. This paper proposes a training framework that progressively generates adversarial attacks on agents' observations to help agents learn a robust cooperative policy. One attacker makes decisions on a hybrid action space that it first chooses an agent to attack and then outputs the perturbation vector. The victim policy is then trained against the attackers. Experimental results show that our generated adversarial attacks are diverse enough to improve the agents' robustness against possible disturbances. "}}

Currently, the model is commonly learned by fitting historical transition data through empirical risk minimization (ERM). However, we discover that simple data fitting can lead to a model that will be totally wrong in guiding policy learning due to the selection bias in offline dataset collection. In this work, we introduce weighted empirical risk minimization (WERM) to handle this problem in model learning.  A typical WERM method utilizes inverse propensity scores to re-weight the training data to approximate the target distribution. However, during the policy training, the data distributions of the candidate policies can be various and unknown. Thus, we propose an adversarial weighted empirical risk minimization (AWRM) objective that learns the model with respect to the worst case of the target distributions. We implement AWRM in a sequential decision structure, resulting in the GALILEO model learning algorithm. We also discover that GALILEO is closely related to adversarial model learning, explaining the empirical effectiveness of the latter. We apply GALILEO in synthetic tasks and verify that GALILEO makes accurate predictions on counterfactual data. We finally applied GALILEO in real-world offline policy learning tasks and found that GALILEO significantly improves policy performance in real-world testing."}}

During our experience of applying offline RL, we noticed that previous offline RL benchmarks commonly involve significant reality gaps, which we have identified include rich and overly exploratory datasets, degraded baseline, and missing policy validation. In many real-world situations, to ensure system safety, running an overly exploratory policy to collect various data is prohibited, thus only a narrow data distribution is available. The resulting policy is regarded as effective if it is better than the working behavior policy; the policy model can be deployed only if it has been well validated, rather than accomplished the training. In this paper, we present a Near real-world offline RL benchmark, named NeoRL, to reflect these properties. NeoRL datasets are collected with a more conservative strategy. Moreover, NeoRL contains the offline training and offline validation pipeline before the online test, corresponding to real-world situations. We then evaluate recent state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms in NeoRL. The empirical results demonstrate that some offline RL algorithms are less competitive to the behavior cloning and the deterministic behavior policy, implying that they could be less effective in real-world tasks than in the previous benchmarks. We also disclose that current offline policy evaluation methods could hardly select the best policy. We hope this work will shed some light on future research and deploying RL in real-world systems."}}

A popular algorithm configuration tuning paradigm is dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC), in which an agent learns dynamic configuration policies across instances by reinforcement learning (RL). However, in many complex algorithms, there may exist different types of configuration hyperparameters, and such heterogeneity may bring difficulties for classic DAC which uses a single-agent RL policy. In this paper, we aim to address this issue and propose multi-agent DAC (MA-DAC), with one agent working for one type of configuration hyperparameter. MA-DAC formulates the dynamic configuration of a complex algorithm with multiple types of hyperparameters as a contextual multi-agent Markov decision process and solves it by a cooperative multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm. To instantiate, we apply MA-DAC to a well-known optimization algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems. Experimental results show the effectiveness of MA-DAC in not only achieving superior performance compared with other configuration tuning approaches based on heuristic rules, multi-armed bandits, and single-agent RL, but also being capable of generalizing to different problem classes. Furthermore, we release the environments in this paper as a benchmark for testing MARL algorithms, with the hope of facilitating the application of MARL."}}
