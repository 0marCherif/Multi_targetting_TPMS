Namely, we achieve for any constant $c>0$ a sketching dimension of $\\tilde{O}(d^{1+c})$ for $\\ell_1$ regression and $\\tilde{O}(\\mu d^{1+c})$ for logistic regression, where $\\mu$ is a standard measure that captures the complexity of compressing the data. For $\\ell_1$-regression our sketching dimension is near-linear and improves previous work which either required $\\Omega(\\log d)$-approximation with this sketching dimension, or required a larger $\\operatorname{poly}(d)$ number of rows. Similarly, for logistic regression previous work had worse $\\operatorname{poly}(\\mu d)$ factors in its sketching dimension. We also give a tradeoff that yields a $1+\\varepsilon$ approximation in input sparsity time by increasing the total size to $(d\\log(n)/\\varepsilon)^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$ for $\\ell_1$ and to $(\\mu d\\log(n)/\\varepsilon)^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$ for logistic regression. Finally, we show that our sketch can be extended to approximate a regularized version of logistic regression where the data-dependent regularizer corresponds to the variance of the individual logistic losses."}}

{"id": "zgyfw0Y45pR", "cdate": 1546300800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Single Machine Batch Scheduling to Minimize the Weighted Number of Tardy Jobs", "abstract": "The $1|B,r_j|\\sum w_jU_j$ scheduling problem takes as input a batch setup time $\\Delta$ and a set of $n$ jobs, each having a processing time, a release date, a weight, and a due date; the task is to find a sequence of batches that minimizes the weighted number of tardy jobs. This problem was introduced by Hochbaum and Landy in 1994; as a wide generalization of {\\sc Knapsack}, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard. In this work we provide a multivariate complexity analysis of the $1|B,r_j|\\sum w_jU_j$ problem with respect to several natural parameters. That is, we establish a thorough classification into fixed-parameter tractable and $\\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard problems, for parameter combinations of (i) $\\#p$ = distinct number of processing times, (ii) $\\#w$ = number of distinct weights, (iii) $\\#d$ = number of distinct due dates, (iv) $\\#r$ = number of distinct release dates, and (v) $b$ = batch sizes. Thereby, we significantly extend the work of Hermelin et al. (2018) who analyzed the parameterized complexity of the non-batch variant of this problem without release dates. As one of our key results, we prove that $1|B,r_j|\\sum w_jU_j$ is $\\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard parameterized by the number of distinct processing times and distinct due dates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parameterized intractability results for scheduling problems with few distinct processing times. Further, we show that $1|B,r_j|\\sum w_jU_j$ is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to parameter $\\#p+\\#d+\\#r$ and with respect to parameter $\\#w+\\#d$ if there is just a single release date. Both results hold even if the number of jobs per batch is limited by some integer $b$."}}

In this setting, we are given a set jobs, each of which is characterized by a processing time, a weight, and the job also has some resource requirement. At fixed points in time, a certain amount of the resource is made available to be consumed by the jobs. The goal is to assign the jobs non-preemptively to time slots on the machine, so that at any time their resource requirement does not exceed the available amounts of resources. The objective that we consider here is the minimization of the sum of weighted completion times.   We give polynomial approximation algorithms and complexity results for single scheduling machine problems. In particular, we show strong NP-hardness of the case of unit resource requirements and weights ($1|rm=1,a_j=1|\\sum C_j$), thus answering an open question of Gy\\\"orgyi and Kis. We also prove that the schedule corresponding to the Shortest Processing Time First ordering provides a $3/2$-approximation for the same problem. We give simple constant factor approximations and a more complicated PTAS for the case of $0$ processing times ($1|rm=1,p_j=0|\\sum w_jC_j$). We close the paper by proposing a new variant of the problem in which the resource arrival times are unknown. A $4$-approximation is presented for this variant, together with an $(4-\\varepsilon)$-inapproximability result."}}
