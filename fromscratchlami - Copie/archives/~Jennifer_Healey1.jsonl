In the early stages of the design process, with the goal of eliciting a client's preferred creative direction, designers will typically create thematic collections of inspirational images called \"mood-boards\". Creating a mood-board involves sequential image searches which are currently performed using keywords or images. Gaud\u00ed transforms this process into a conversation where the user is gradually detailing the mood-board's theme. This representation allows our AI to generate new search queries from scratch, straight from a project briefing, following a theme hypothesized by GPT-3. Compared to previous computational approaches to mood-board creation, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to represent mood-boards as the stories that designers tell when presenting a creative direction to a client."}}

Unlike many internet scale systems that use a singular set of search terms and return a ranked list of options from amongst thousands, our system uses multi-turn user dialog to deeply understand the user\u2019s preferences. The system responds in context to the user\u2019s specific and immediate feedback to make sequential recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64 scenario-based search journeys. When our recommendation system was successfully triggered, we saw both an increase in efficiency and a higher confidence rating with respect to final user choice. We also found that users preferred our system (75%) compared with the baseline."}}

People often express their preferences in terms of a critique of the current recommendation (e.g., \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for a date\u201d), requiring some degree of common sense for a preference to be inferred. In this work, we present a method for transforming a user critique into a positive preference (e.g., \u201cI prefer more romantic\u201d) in order to retrieve reviews pertaining to potentially better recommendations (e.g., \u201cPerfect for a romantic dinner\u201d). We leverage a large neural language model (LM) in a few-shot setting to perform critique-to-preference transformation, and we test two methods for retrieving recommendations: one that matches embeddings, and another that fine-tunes an LM for the task. We instantiate this approach in the restaurant domain and evaluate it using a new dataset of restaurant critiques. In an ablation study, we show that utilizing critique-to-preference transformation improves recommendations, and that there are at least three general cases that explain this improved performance."}}
