However, previous methods learned from 1D SMILES sequences or 2D molecular graphs failed to achieve high accuracy as QC properties primarily depend on the 3D equilibrium conformations optimized by electronic structure methods, far different from the sequence-type and graph-type data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Uni-Mol+ to tackle this challenge. Uni-Mol+ first generates a raw 3D molecule conformation from inexpensive methods such as RDKit. Then, the raw conformation is iteratively updated to its target DFT equilibrium conformation using neural networks, and the learned conformation will be used to predict the QC properties. To effectively learn this update process towards the equilibrium conformation, we introduce a two-track Transformer model backbone and train it with the QC property prediction task. We also design a novel approach to guide the model's training process. Our extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that the proposed Uni-Mol+ significantly improves the accuracy of QC property prediction in various datasets. We have made the code and model publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol}."}}

Recent methods attempted to solve the 3D reconstruction problem with the autoencoder architecture, which suffers from the latent vector space sampling problem and frequently produces suboptimal pose inferences and inferior 3D reconstructions. Here we present an improved autoencoder architecture called ACE (Asymmetric Complementary autoEncoder), based on which we designed the ACE-EM method for cryo-EM 3D reconstructions. Compared to previous methods, ACE-EM reached higher pose space coverage within the same training time and boosted the reconstruction performance regardless of the choice of decoders. With this method, the Nyquist resolution (highest possible resolution) was reached for 3D reconstructions of both simulated and experimental cryo-EM datasets. Furthermore, ACE-EM is the only amortized inference method that reached the Nyquist resolution."}}

The central problem in cryo-EM is to recover the underlying 3-dimensional (3D) objects from 2-dimensional (2D) projection images. Aside from signal corruptions and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio, a major challenge in cryo-EM 3D reconstruction is to estimate the poses of 3D objects during the projection image formation, which are missing from experimental measurements. Recent methods attempted to solve the pose estimation problem using the autoencoder architecture. A key issue with this approach is that the latent vector is only indirectly updated through the decoder. The encoder's learning of the pose space can be easily trapped in a local subspace, resulting in suboptimal pose inferences and inferior 3D reconstruction quality. Here we present a modified autoencoder architecture called ACE (asymmetric complementary autoencoder) and designed the ACE-EM method to solve this issue, which consists of two tasks. The first task takes projection images and outputs predicted images using an image encoder followed by a pose decoder. The second task reverses the order of encoder and decoder, which takes randomly sampled poses and outputs predicted poses. The two tasks complement each other and can achieve a more balanced training of the encoder-decoder parameters. Compared to other methods, ACE-EM can reach higher pose space coverage within the same training time and has achieved state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction results for several benchmark datasets. "}}

To combat this pandemic efficiently, governments usually need to coordinate essential resources across multiple regions and adjust intervention polices at the right time, which all call for accurate and robust forecasting of future epidemic trends. However, designing such a forecasting system is non-trivial, since we need to handle all kinds of locations at different administrative levels, which include pretty different epidemic-evolving patterns. Moreover, there are dynamic and volatile correlations of pandemic conditions among these locations, which further enlarge the difficulty in forecasting. With these challenges in mind, we develop a novel spatial-temporal forecasting framework. First, to accommodate all kinds of locations at different administrative levels, we propose a unified hierarchical view, which mimics the aggregation procedure of pandemic statistics. Then, this view motivates us to facilitate joint learning across administrative levels and inspires us to design the cross-level consistency loss as an extra regularization to stabilize model training. Besides, to capture those dynamic and volatile spatial correlations, we design a customized spatial module with adaptive edge gates, which can both reinforce effective messages and disable irrelevant ones. We put this framework into production to help the battle against COVID-19 in the United States. A comprehensive online evaluation across three months demonstrates that our projections are the most competitive ones among all results produced by dozens of international group and even surpass the official ensemble in many cases. We also visualize our unique edge gates to understand the evolvement of spatial correlations and present intuitive case studies. Besides, we open source our implementation at https://github.com/dolphin-zs/HierST to facilitate future research towards better epidemic modeling."}}
