CRLB is a lower bound on the variance of the estimator, the change of CRLB can indicate the effect of the specific factor to the DoA estimator, and in this paper a Laplace prior and the three-stage framework are used for the DoA estimation. We derive the CRLBs under different scenarios: (i) if the unknown parameters consist of deterministic and random variables, a hybrid CRLB is derived; (ii) if all the unknown parameters are random, a Bayesian CRLB is derived, and the marginalized Bayesian CRLB is obtained by marginalizing out the nuisance parameter. We also derive the CRLBs of the hyperparameters involved in the three-stage model and explore the effect of multiple snapshots to the CRLBs. We compare the derived CRLBs of SBL, finding that the marginalized Bayesian CRLB is tighter than other CRLBs when SNR is low and the differences between CRLBs become smaller when SNR is high. We also study the relationship between the mean squared error of the source magnitudes and the CRLBs, including numerical simulation results with a variety of antenna configurations such as different numbers of receivers and different noise conditions."}}

Recently, the random modulation mixes a signal with different pseudorandom sequences using multiple branches of channels before sampling. In previous work, we introduced the design of a single spectrally shaped binary sequence that mitigates interferers to replace the pseudorandom sequence in a channel. However, the designed sequences cannot provide a stable recovery achieved by pseudorandom sequence approaches. In this paper, we extend our previous sequence design to guarantee stable recovery by designing a set of spectrally shaped sequences to be orthogonal to each other. We show that it is difficult to find the necessary number of sequences (equal to the sequence length) featuring mutual orthogonality and introduce oversampling to the sequence set design to improve the recovery performance of the designed sequences. We propose an algorithm for multibranch sequence design as a binary optimization problem, which is solved using a semidefinite program relaxation and randomized projection. In addition, while it is common to model narrowband interferers as a subspace spanned by a subset of elements from the Fourier basis, we show that the Slepian basis provides an alternative and more suitable compact representation for signals with components contained in narrow spectrum bands. Numerical experiments using the proposed sequence sets show their advantages against pseudorandom sequences and our previous work."}}

While variable selection in statistics aims \nto distinguish between true and false predictors, feature selection in machine learning aims to reduce the \ndimensionality of the data while preserving the performance of the learning method. The knockoff framework \nhas attracted significant interest due to its strong control of false discoveries while preserving predictive \npower. In contrast to the original approach and later variants that assume a given probabilistic model for the \nvariables, our proposed approach relies on data-driven generative models that learn mappings from data \nspace to a parametric space that characterizes the probability distribution of the data. Our approach \nrequires only the availability of mappings from data space to a distribution in parametric space and from \nparametric space to a distribution in data space; thus, it can be integrated with multiple popular generative \nmodels from machine learning. We provide example knockoff designs using a variational autoencoder and \na Gaussian process latent variable model. We also propose a knockoff score metric for a softmax classifier \nthat accounts for the contribution of each feature and its knockoff during supervised learning. Experimental \nresults with multiple benchmark datasets for feature selection showcase the advantages of our knockoff \ndesigns and the knockoff framework with respect to existing approaches."}}

Nonuniform linear arrays are used to demonstrate the validity and advantages of the proposed method including its improved efficiency and accuracy compared with the state-of-art DoA estimation methods."}}

An exciting and relatively recent development is the uptake of machine learning in the natural sciences, where the major goal is to obtain novel scientific insights and discoveries from observational or simulated data. A prerequisite for obtaining a scientific outcome is domain knowledge, which is needed to gain explainability, but also to enhance scientific consistency. In this article we review explainable machine learning in view of applications in the natural sciences and discuss three core elements which we identified as relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability. With respect to these core elements, we provide a survey of recent scientific works that incorporate machine learning and the way that explainable machine learning is used in combination with domain knowledge from the application areas."}}

In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning method for wearable sensor based human activity recognition, a technique that seeks high-level human activity knowledge from low-level sensor inputs. Due to the high costs to obtain human generated activity data and the ubiquitous similarities between activity modes, it can be more efficient to borrow information from existing activity recognition models than to collect more data to train a new model from scratch when only a few data are available for model training. The proposed few-shot human activity recognition method leverages a deep learning model for feature extraction and classification while knowledge transfer is performed in the manner of model parameter transfer. In order to alleviate negative transfer, we propose a metric to measure cross-domain class-wise relevance so that knowledge of higher relevance is assigned larger weights during knowledge transfer. Promising results in extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed approach."}}

Recently, feature selection methods based on sparse learning have attracted significant attention due to their outstanding performance compared with traditional methods that ignore correlation between features. However, they are restricted by design to linear data transformations, a potential drawback given that the underlying correlation structures of data are often non-linear. To leverage a more sophisticated embedding, we propose an autoencoder-based unsupervised feature selection approach that leverages a single-layer autoencoder for a joint framework of feature selection and manifold learning, with spectral graph analysis on the projected data into the learning process to achieve local data geometry preservation from the original data space to the low-dimensional feature space."}}
