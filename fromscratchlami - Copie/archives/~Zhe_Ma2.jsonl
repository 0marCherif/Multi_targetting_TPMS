Previous works mainly focus on combining different distillation methods, including feature, classification, location and relation, into a mixed scheme to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a task regularized hybrid knowledge distillation method for COD task. First, we propose an image-level hybrid knowledge representation by combining instance-level hard and soft knowledge to use teacher knowledge critically. Second, we propose a task-based regularization distillation loss by taking account of loss and category differences to make continual learning more balance between old and new tasks. We find that, under appropriate knowledge selection and transfer strategies, using only classification distillation can also relieve knowledge forgetting effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO2017 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results under various scenarios. We get an absolute improvement of 27.98 at $RelGap$ under the most difficult five-task scenario. Code is in attachment and will be available on github."}}

It transmits information by $0/1$ spikes. This bio-mimetic mechanism of SNN demonstrates extreme energy efficiency since it avoids any multiplications on neuromorphic hardware. However, the forward-passing $0/1$ spike quantization will cause information loss and accuracy degradation. To deal with this problem, the Information maximization loss (IM-Loss) that aims at maximizing the information flow in the SNN is proposed in the paper. The IM-Loss not only enhances the information expressiveness of an SNN directly but also plays a part of the role of normalization without introducing any additional operations (\\textit{e.g.}, bias and scaling) in the inference phase. Additionally, we introduce a novel differentiable spike activity estimation, Evolutionary Surrogate Gradients (ESG) in SNNs. By appointing automatic evolvable surrogate gradients for spike activity function, ESG can ensure sufficient model updates at the beginning and accurate gradients at the end of the training, resulting in both easy convergence and high task performance. Experimental results on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets show that the SNN models trained by our method outperform the current state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

Motivated by this assumption, a training-inference decoupling method for SNNs named as Real Spike is proposed, which not only enjoys both unshared convolution kernels and binary spikes in inference-time but also maintains both shared convolution kernels and Real-valued Spikes during training. This decoupling mechanism of SNN is realized by a re-parameterization technique.

It transmits binary spike signals between network units when the membrane potential exceeds the firing threshold. This biomimetic mechanism of SNN appears energy-efficiency with its power sparsity and asynchronous operations on spike events. Unfortunately, with the propagation of binary spikes, the distribution of membrane potential will shift, leading to degeneration, saturation, and gradient mismatch problems, which would be disadvantageous to the network optimization and convergence. Such undesired shifts would prevent the SNN from performing well and going deep. To tackle these problems, we attempt to rectify the membrane potential distribution (MPD) by designing a novel distribution loss, MPD-Loss, which can explicitly penalize the un-desired shifts without introducing any additional operations in the inference phase. Moreover, the proposed method can also mitigate the quantization error in SNNs, which is usually ignored in other works. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can directly train a deeper, larger, and better-performing SNN within fewer timesteps."}}

It adopts binary spike signals to transmit information. Benefitting from the information passing paradigm of SNNs, the multiplications of activations and weights can be replaced by additions, which are more energy-efficient. However, its \u201cHard Reset\" mechanism for the firing activity would ignore the difference among membrane potentials when the membrane potential is above the firing threshold, causing information loss. Meanwhile, quantifying the membrane potential to 0/1 spikes at the firing instants will inevitably introduce the quantization error thus bringing about information loss too. To address these problems, we propose to use the \u201cSoft Reset\" mechanism for the supervised training-based SNNs, which will drive the membrane potential to a dynamic reset potential according to its magnitude, and Membrane Potential Rectifier (MPR) to reduce the quantization error via redistributing the membrane potential to a range close to the spikes. Results show that the SNNs with the \u201cSoft Reset\" mechanism and MPR outperform their vanilla counterparts on both static and dynamic datasets."}}

However, most existing methods ignore exploring the class-level knowledge that can be easily learned by humans from just a handful of samples. In this paper, we propose an Explicit Class Knowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN), which is composed of the comparison, squeeze and calibration modules, to address this problem. Specifically, we first employ the comparison module to explore the pairwise sample relations to learn rich sample representations in the instance-level graph. Then, we squeeze the instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help obtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate modeling the relations of different classes. Next, the calibration module is adopted to characterize the relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative class-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level knowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference of the query samples. We conduct extensive experiments on four few-shot classification benchmarks, and the experimental results show that the proposed ECKPN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}}

The advancing-front-Delaunay method is a mainstream method to generate the triangular mesh. However, it generates interior nodes on the basis of the segment front and needs to manage and update the generation segment front set carefully. This paper describes an improved advancing-front-Delaunay method that generates interior nodes based on the node front. The idea of node front can be implemented easily by our disk packing algorithm and does not need a complicated management strategy. Besides, unlike the traditional advancing-front-Delaunay method that generates interior node and the mesh at the same time, the method generates all the nodes firstly by the disk packing method, then generates the mesh. Hence, the method can be more efficient using these more efficient algorithms for a given fixed node-set to generate Delaunay triangular meshes or these more efficient algorithms with a carefully designed insertion sequence to insert the interior nodes. Four examples are given to show the effectiveness and robustness of the improved advancing-front-Delaunay method."}}
