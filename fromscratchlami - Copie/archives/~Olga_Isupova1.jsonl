This is the first framework that gives a time-evolving representation of the interdependencies between the components of the sparse signal of interest. A hierarchical Gaussian process describes such structure and the interdependencies are represented via the covariance matrices of the prior distributions. The inference is based on the expectation propagation method and the theoretical derivation of the posterior distribution is provided in the paper. The inference framework is thoroughly evaluated over synthetic, real video and electroencephalography (EEG) data where the spatio-temporal evolving patterns need to be reconstructed with high accuracy. It is shown that it achieves 15% improvement of the F-measure compared with the alternating direction method of multipliers, spatio-temporal sparse Bayesian learning method and one-level Gaussian process model. Additionally, the required memory for the proposed algorithm is less than in the one-level Gaussian process model. This structured sparse regression framework is of broad applicability to source localisation and object detection problems with sparse signals."}}

We co-create products with UK and in-country commercial, GO and NGO partners to ensure the machine learning algorithms address appropriate user needs whether for tactical decision making or evidence-based policy decisions. In one particular case, we developed and deployed a novel algorithm, BCCNet, to quickly process large quantities of unstructured data to prevent and respond to natural disasters. Crowdsourcing provides an efficient mechanism to generate labels from unstructured data to prime machine learning algorithms for large scale data analysis. However, these labels are often imperfect with qualities varying among different citizen scientists, which prohibits their direct use with many state-of-theart machine learning techniques. We describe BCCNet, a framework that simultaneously aggregates biased and contradictory labels from the crowd and trains an automatic classifier to process new data. Our case studies, mosquito sound detection for malaria prevention and damage detection for disaster response, show the efficacy of our method in the challenging context of developing world applications."}}

In current deep sparse coding methods uncertainty of predictions is rarely estimated, thus providing the results that lack the quantitative justification. Bayesian learning provides the way to estimate the uncertainty of predictions in neural networks (NNs) by imposing the prior distributions on weights, propagating the resulting uncertainty through the layers and computing the posterior distributions of predictions. We propose a novel method of propagating the uncertainty through the sparsity-promoiting layers of NNs for the first time. We design a Bayesian Learned Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding network (BayesLIsTA). An efficient posterior inference algorithm based on probabilistic backpropagation is developed. Experiments on sparse coding show that the proposed framework provides both accurate predictions and sensible estimates of uncertainty in these predictions."}}
