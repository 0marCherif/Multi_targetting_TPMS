While work in this area targets diverse kinds of robust behaviour, we argue in this work in favour requirement that should apply more generally: For robust behaviour to be scalable, it should transfer flexibly across familiar object classes, and not be separately learned for every class of interest. To this end, we propose the systematic robustness setting, in which certain combinations of classes and attributes are systematically excluded during training. Unlike prior work which studies systematic generalisation in DNNs or their susceptibility to spurious correlations, we use synthetic operations and data sampling to scale such experiments up to large-scale naturalistic datasets. This allows for a compromise between ecological validity of the task and strict experimental controls. We analyse a variety of models and learning objectives, and find that robustness to different shifts such as image corruptions, image rotations, and abstract object depictions are perhaps harder to deal with than previous results would suggest. This extended abstract describes the general experimental setting, our specific instantiations, and a metric to measure systematic robustness."}}

We advocate a view of this challenge that is more closely informed by the problem of visual recognition, and which emphasizes dynamic model behaviour as opposed to centering the statistical properties of training and test distributions. We introduce an experimental setting geared towards developing models that can exhibit robust behaviour in a reliable and scalable manner. We refer to this requirement as \"systematic robustness\", which involves excluding certain combinations of classes and image attributes systematically during training. Unlike prior work which studies systematic generalisation in DNNs or their susceptibility to spurious correlations, we use synthetic operations and data sampling to scale such experiments up to large naturalistic datasets."}}

Mapping from the 2D image space to the prediction space is difficult: perspective ambiguities make the loss function noisy and training data is scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel approach (Neural Body Fitting (NBF)). It integrates a statistical body model within a CNN, leveraging reliable bottom-up semantic body part segmentation and robust top-down body model constraints. NBF is fully differentiable and can be trained using 2D and 3D annotations. In detailed experiments, we analyze how the components of our model affect performance, especially the use of part segmentations as an explicit intermediate representation, and present a robust, efficiently trainable framework for 3D human pose estimation from 2D images with competitive results on standard benchmarks.

This problem offers a common mathematical abstraction of seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks, including instance-separating semantic segmentation, articulated human body pose estimation and multiple object tracking. Conceptually, it generalizes the unconstrained integer quadratic program and the minimum cost lifted multicut problem, both of which are NP-hard. In order to find feasible solutions efficiently, we define two local search algorithms that converge monotonously to a local optimum, offering a feasible solution at any time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in tackling computer vision tasks, we apply them to instances of the problem that we construct from published data, using published algorithms. We report state-of-the-art application-specific accuracy in the three above-mentioned applications."}}

We enable our analysis by creating a human baseline for pedestrian detection (over the Caltech dataset), and by manually clustering the recurrent errors of a top detector. Our results characterise both localisation and background-versusforeground errors. To address localisation errors we study the impact of training annotation noise on the detector performance, and show that we can improve even with a small portion of sanitised training data. To address background/foreground discrimination, we study convnets for pedestrian detection, and discuss which factors affect their performance. Other than our in-depth analysis, we report top performance on the Caltech dataset, and provide a new sanitised set of training and test annotations."}}

Since labelling object boundaries is one of the most expensive types of annotations, there is a need to relax the requirement to carefully annotate images to make both the training more affordable and to extend the amount of training data. In this paper we propose a technique to generate weakly supervised annotations and show that bounding box annotations alone suffice to reach high-quality object boundaries without using any object-specific boundary annotations. With the proposed weak supervision techniques we achieve the top performance on the object boundary detection task, outperforming by a large margin the current fully supervised state-of-theart methods."}}

Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes. To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations, 20 000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark."}}

Despite their recent diverse successes, convnets historically underperform compared to other pedestrian detectors. We deliberately omit explicitly modelling the problem into the network (e.g. parts or occlusion modelling) and show that we can reach competitive performance without bells and whistles. In a wide range of experiments we analyse small and big convnets, their architectural choices, parameters, and the influence of different training data, including pretraining on surrogate tasks. We present the best convnet detectors on the Caltech and KITTI dataset. On Caltech our convnets reach top performance both for the Caltech1x and Caltech10x training setup. Using additional data at training time our strongest convnet model is competitive even to detectors that use additional data (optical flow) at test time."}}
