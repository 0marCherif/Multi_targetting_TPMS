Most recent studies in OOD detection utilize the information from a single representation that resides in the penultimate layer to determine whether the input is anomalous or not. Although such a method is straightforward, the potential of diverse information in the intermediate layers is overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on contrastive learning that encourages intermediate features to learn layer-specialized representations and assembles them implicitly into a single representation to absorb rich information in the pre-trained language model. Extensive experiments in various intent classification and OOD datasets demonstrate that our approach is significantly more effective than other works."}}

In order to address these requirements, Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) has emerged as a novel research area in computer vision, focusing on achieving both adaptation ability and robustness (i.e., the ability to detect out-of-distribution samples).

Our benchmark encompasses multiple datasets with varying difficulty levels and characteristics, including temporal shifts and diverse domains. On top of our testbed, we validate existing UniDA methods from computer vision and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques from NLP literature, yielding valuable findings: We observe that UniDA methods originally designed for image input can be effectively transferred to the natural language domain while also underscoring the effect of adaptation difficulty in determining the model\u2019s performance."}}

However, the ICL performance does not scale well with the number of available training samples as it is limited by the inherent input length constraint of the underlying language model.

This paper proposes prompt-augmented linear probing (PALP), a hybrid of linear probing and ICL, which leverages the best of both worlds. PALP inherits the scalability of linear probing and the capability of enforcing language models to derive more meaningful representations via tailoring input into a more conceivable form. Throughout in-depth investigations on various datasets, we verified that PALP significantly enhances the input representations closing the gap between ICL in the data-hungry scenario and fine-tuning in the data-abundant scenario with little training overhead, potentially making PALP a strong alternative in a black-box scenario."}}

While English, due to its widespread usage, is typically regarded as the primary language for model adaption in various tasks, recent studies have revealed that the efficacy of XLT can be amplified by selecting the most appropriate source languages based on specific conditions. In this work, we propose the utilization of sub-network similarity between two languages as a proxy for predicting the compatibility of the languages in the context of XLT. Our approach is model-oriented, better reflecting the inner workings of foundation models. In addition, it requires only a moderate amount of raw text from candidate languages, distinguishing it from the majority of previous methods that rely on external resources. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more effective than baselines across diverse tasks. Specifically, it shows proficiency in ranking candidates for zero-shot XLT, achieving an improvement of 4.6% on average in terms of NDCG@3. We also provide extensive analyses that confirm the utility of sub-networks for XLT prediction."}}

Such a process (i.e., in-context learning), however, naturally leads to high reliance on the demonstrations which are usually selected from external datasets. In this paper, we propose self-generated in-context learning (SG-ICL), which generates demonstrations for in-context learning from PLM itself to minimize the reliance on the external demonstration. We conduct experiments on four different text classification tasks and show SG-ICL significantly outperforms zero-shot learning and is generally worth approximately 0.6 gold training samples. Moreover, our generated demonstrations show more consistent performance with low variance compared to randomly selected demonstrations from the training dataset."}}
