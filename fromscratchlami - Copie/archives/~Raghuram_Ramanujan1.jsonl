Early theoretical work established the game-theoretic soundness and convergence bounds for Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT), the most popular instantiation of MCTS; however, there remain notable gaps in our understanding of how UCT behaves in practice. In this work, we address one such gap by considering the question of whether UCT can exhibit lookahead pathology -- a paradoxical phenomenon first observed in Minimax search where greater search effort leads to worse decision-making. We introduce a novel family of synthetic games that offer rich modeling possibilities while remaining amenable to mathematical analysis. Our theoretical and experimental results suggest that UCT is indeed susceptible to pathological behavior in a range of games drawn from this family."}}

However, recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have produced systems that surpass human performance on a variety of control tasks. This paper investigates the potential of using RL to develop a novel reactive steering algorithm for RDW. Our approach uses RL to train a deep neural network that directly prescribes the rotation, translation, and curvature gains to transform a virtual environment given a user's position and orientation in the tracked space. We compare our learned algorithm to steer-to-center using simulated and real paths. We found that our algorithm outperforms steer-to-center on simulated paths, and found no significant difference on distance traveled on real paths. We demonstrate that when modeled as a continuous control problem, RDW is a suitable domain for RL, and moving forward, our general framework provides a promising path towards an optimal RDW steering algorithm."}}

Our approach uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to generate new formulas by mimicking the structural properties of a given input formula Phi. We proceed in two phases: first, we construct the Literal-Incidence Graph (LIG) of Phi. This is used by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new LIGs that exhibit graph-theoretic properties similar to those of the LIG of Phi. In the second phase, we extract a formula whose LIG would correspond to the generated graph. We show that generating such a formula is equivalent to finding a minimal clique edge cover of the given graph, which we tackle efficiently using a greedy hill-climbing algorithm. We verify experimentally that our approach generates formulas that closely resemble a given real-world SAT instance, as measured by a range of different metrics."}}

Then, we experimented with various search algorithms to explore the salad recipe space and discover novel ingredient combinations. Surprisingly, we discovered that the top ranked recipes from a randomly generated population were already of high quality, obviating the need for search. To validate the quality of our automatically generated salads, we conducted a blind taste test pitting three computer-designed and three human-designed salads against each other. We discovered that the best performing computer salad was competitive with the human generated salads."}}

We provide an in-depth analysis of the potential of UCT in domain-independent settings, in cases where heuristic values are available, and the effect of enhancing random playouts to more informed playouts between two weak minimax players. To provide further insights, we develop synthetic game tree instances and discuss interesting properties of UCT, both empirically and analytically."}}
