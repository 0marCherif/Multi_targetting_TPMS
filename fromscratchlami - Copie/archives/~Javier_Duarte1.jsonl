The material for the report builds on two workshops held by the Fast ML for Science community and covers three main areas: applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains; techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms; and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms. We also present overlapping challenges across the multiple scientific domains where common solutions can be found. This community report is intended to give plenty of examples and inspiration for scientific discovery through integrated and accelerated ML solutions. This is followed by a high-level overview and organization of technical advances, including an abundance of pointers to source material, which can enable these breakthroughs."}}

As a working example, we consider the DarkMachines challenge dataset. We show how different design choices (e.g., event representations, anomaly score definitions, network architectures) affect the result on specific benchmark new physics models. Once a baseline is established, we discuss how to improve the anomaly detection accuracy by exploiting normalizing flow layers in the latent space of the variational autoencoder."}}

Where previously these sets of data have been formulated as series or image data to match the available machine learning architectures, with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs), these systems can be learned natively as graphs. This allows a wide variety of high- and low-level physical features to be attached to measurements and, by the same token, a wide variety of HEP tasks to be accomplished by the same GNN architectures. GNNs have found powerful use-cases in reconstruction, tagging, generation and end-to-end analysis. With the wide-spread adoption of GNNs in industry, the HEP community is well-placed to benefit from rapid improvements in GNN latency and memory usage. However, industry use-cases are not perfectly aligned with HEP and much work needs to be done to best match unique GNN capabilities to unique HEP obstacles. We present here a range of these capabilities, predictions of which are currently being well-adopted in HEP communities, and which are still immature. We hope to capture the landscape of graph techniques in machine learning as well as point out the most significant gaps that are inhibiting potentially large leaps in research."}}
