Classical work on such bounds in repeated games makes the strong assumption that the subsequent rounds of the repeated games are independent beyond any influence on play from past history. This work studies such bounds in environments that themselves change due to the actions of the agents. Concretely, we consider this problem in discrete-time queuing systems, where competitive queues try to get their packets served. In this model, a queue gets to send a packet at each step to one of the servers, which will attempt to serve the oldest arriving packet, and unprocessed packets are returned to each queue. We model this as a repeated game where queues compete for the capacity of the servers, but where the state of the game evolves as the length of each queue varies. We analyze this queuing system from multiple perspectives. As a baseline measure, we first establish precise conditions on the queuing arrival rates and service capacities that ensure all packets clear efficiently under centralized coordination. We then show that if queues strategically choose servers according to independent and stationary distributions, the system remains stable provided it would be stable under coordination with arrival rates scaled up by a factor of just \\(\\frac{e}{e-1}\\). Finally, we extend these results to no-regret learning dynamics: if queues use learning algorithms satisfying the no-regret property to choose servers, then the requisite factor increases to 2, and both of these bounds are tight. Both of these results require new probabilistic techniques compared to the classical price of anarchy literature and show that in such settings, no-regret learning can exhibit efficiency loss due to myopia."}}

A typical advertiser may participate in thousands of auctions each day with bids tailored to a variety of signals about user demographics and intent. These auctions are strategically linked through a global budget constraint. To help address the difficulty of bidding, many major online platforms now provide automated budget management via a flexible approach called budget pacing: rather than bidding directly, an advertiser specifies a global budget target and a maximum willingness-to-pay for different types of advertising opportunities. The specified maximums are then scaled down (or \"paced\") by a multiplier so that the realized total spend matches the target budget. These automated bidders are now near-universally adopted across all mature advertising platforms, raising pressing questions about market outcomes that arise when advertisers use budget pacing simultaneously. In this paper we study the aggregate welfare and individual regret guarantees of dynamic pacing algorithms in repeated auctions with budgets. We show that when agents simultaneously use a natural form of gradient-based pacing, the liquid welfare obtained over the course of the dynamics is at least half the optimal liquid welfare obtainable by any allocation rule, matching the best possible bound for static auctions even in pure Nash equilibria [Aggarwal et al., WINE 2019; Babaioff et al., ITCS 2021]. In contrast to prior work, these results hold without requiring convergence of the dynamics, circumventing known computational obstacles of finding equilibria [Chen et al., EC 2021]. Our result is robust to the correlation structure among agents' valuations and holds for any core auction, a broad class that includes first-price, second-price, and GSP auctions. We complement the aggregate guarantees by showing that an agent using such pacing algorithms achieves an O(T^{3/4}) regret relative to the value obtained by the best fixed pacing multiplier in hindsight in stochastic bidding environments. Compared to past work, this result applies to more general auctions and extends to adversarial settings with respect to dynamic regret."}}

These works make it clear the global expansion properties of posets depend strongly on their underlying architecture (e.g. simplicial, cubical, linear algebraic), but the overall phenomenon remains poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the advantage of different poset architectures in both a spectral and combinatorial sense, highlighting how regularity controls the spectral decay and edge-expansion of corresponding random walks. We show that the spectra of walks on expanding posets (Dikstein, Dinur, Filmus, Harsha APPROX-RANDOM 2018) concentrate in strips around a small number of approximate eigenvalues controlled by the regularity of the underlying poset. This gives a simple condition to identify poset architectures (e.g. the Grassmann) that exhibit exponential decay of eigenvalues, versus architectures like hypergraphs whose eigenvalues decay linearly -- a crucial distinction in applications to hardness of approximation such as the recent proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018).

In this model, a queue gets to send a packet each step to one of the servers, which will attempt to serve the oldest arriving packet, and unprocessed packets are returned to each queue. We model this as a repeated game where queues compete for the capacity of the servers, but where the state of the game evolves as the length of each queue varies, resulting in a highly dependent random process. In classical work for learning in repeated games, the learners evaluate the outcome of their strategy in each step---in our context, this means that queues estimate their success probability at each server. Earlier work by the authors [in EC'20] shows that with no-regret learners, the system needs twice the capacity as would be required in the coordinated setting to ensure queue lengths remain stable despite the selfish behavior of the queues. In this paper, we demonstrate that this myopic way of evaluating outcomes is suboptimal: if more patient queues choose strategies that selfishly maximize their long-run success rate, stability can be ensured with just e/e-1 ~1.58 times extra capacity, strictly better than what is possible assuming the no-regret property. As these systems induce highly dependent random processes, our analysis draws heavily on techniques from the theory of stochastic processes to establish various game-theoretic properties of these systems. Though these systems are random even under fixed stationary policies by the queues, we show using careful probabilistic arguments that surprisingly, under such fixed policies, these systems have essentially deterministic and explicit asymptotic behavior. We show that the growth rate of a set can be written as the ratio of a submodular and modular function, and use the resulting explicit description to show that the subsets of queues with largest growth rate are closed under union and non-disjoint intersections, which we use in turn to prove the claimed sharp bicriteria result for the equilibria of the resulting system. Our equilibrium analysis relies on a novel deformation argument towards a more analyzable solution that is quite different from classical price of anarchy bounds. While the intermediate points in this deformation will not be Nash, the structure will ensure the relevant constraints and incentives similarly hold to establish monotonicity along this continuous path."}}
