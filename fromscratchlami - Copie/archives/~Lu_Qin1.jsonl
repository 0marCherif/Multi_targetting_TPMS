Existing clique model mainly focuses on unsigned networks. However, in real world, many applications are modeled as signed networks with positive and negative edges. As the signed networks hold their own properties different from the unsigned networks, the existing clique model is inapplicable for the signed networks. Motivated by this, we propose the balanced clique model that considers the most fundamental and dominant theory, structural balance theory, for signed networks. Following the balanced clique model, we study the <u>m</u> aximal <u>b</u> alanced <u>c</u> lique <u>e</u> numeration problem ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\mathsf {MBCE}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> ) which computes all the maximal balanced cliques in a given signed network. Moreover, in some applications, users prefer a unique and representative balanced clique with maximum size rather than all balanced cliques. Thus, we also study the <u>m</u> aximum <u>b</u> alanced <u>c</u> lique <u>s</u> earch problem ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\mathsf {MBCS}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> ) which computes the balanced clique with maximum size.

For the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\mathsf {MBCE}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> problem, a straightforward solution is to treat the signed network as two unsigned networks and leverage the off-the-shelf techniques for unsigned networks. However, such a solution is inefficient for large signed networks. To address this problem, in this paper, we first propose a new maximal balanced clique enumeration algorithm by exploiting the unique properties of signed networks. Based on the new proposed algorithm, we devise two optimization strategies to further improve the efficiency of the enumeration. For the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\mathsf {MBCS}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> problem, we first propose a baseline solution. To overcome the huge search space problem of the baseline solution, we propose a new search framework based on search space partition. To further improve the efficiency of the new framework, we propose multiple optimization strategies regarding to redundant search branches and invalid candidates. We conduct extensive experiments on large real datasets.

Since a direct search using the Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm results in a large search space, researchers resort to indexing-based approaches. State-of-the-art indexing-based solutions can be categorized into hierarchy-based solutions and hop-based solutions. However, the hierarchy-based solutions require large search space for long-distance queries, while the hop-based solutions result in high computational waste for short-distance queries. To overcome the drawbacks of both solutions, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical 2-hop index (H2H-Index) which assigns a label for each vertex and at the same time preserves a hierarchy among all vertices. With the H2H-Index, we design an efficient query processing algorithm with performance guarantees by visiting part of the labels for the source and the destination based on the hierarchy. We propose a novel algorithm to construct the H2H-Indexbased on distance preserved graphs. We also extend the H2H-Indexand propose a set of algorithms to identify the shortest path between vertices. We conducted extensive performance studies using large real road networks including the whole USA road network. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a speedup of an order of magnitude in query processing compared to the state-of-the-art while consuming comparable indexing time and index size."}}

Most existing cohesive subgraph models mainly consider the structural cohesion but ignore the subgraph significance. In this article, we formulate a new model, called statistically significant clique, to mine significant cohesive subgraphs in large vertex-labeled graphs. A statistically significant clique is a complete subgraph with a significance value exceeding a given threshold. The subgraph significance is evaluated by a widely used metric called chi-square statistic. We study the problem of enumerating all maximal statistically significant cliques. The problem is proved to be NP-hard. We propose an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm with several elegant pruning strategies to solve our problem. We conduct extensive experiments on seven large real-world datasets to show the practical efficiency of our algorithms. We also conduct a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model."}}

Butterfly, which is a complete $$2 \\times 2$$ 2 \u00d7 2 biclique, plays a key role in bipartite graphs. In this paper, we investigate the problem of efficient counting the number of butterflies. The most advanced techniques are based on enumerating wedges which is the dominant cost of counting butterflies. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms cannot efficiently handle large-scale bipartite graphs. This becomes a bottleneck in large-scale applications. In this paper, instead of the existing layer-priority-based techniques, we propose a vertex-priority-based paradigm $${\\mathsf {BFC}}$$ BFC - $${\\mathsf {VP}}$$ VP to enumerate much fewer wedges; this leads to a significant improvement of the time complexity of the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, we present cache-aware strategies to further improve the time efficiency while theoretically retaining the time complexity of $${\\mathsf {BFC}}$$ BFC - $${\\mathsf {VP}}$$ VP . We also show that our proposed techniques can work efficiently in external and parallel contexts. Moreover, we study the butterfly counting problem on batch-dynamic graphs. Specifically, given a bipartite graph G and a batch-update of edges B, we aim to maintain the number of butterflies in G. To tackle this problem, fast vertex-priority-based algorithms are proposed with optimizations for reducing the computation of existing wedges in G. Our extensive empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed techniques significantly outperform the baseline solutions on real datasets."}}

Nevertheless, with the ever-growing popularity of online social media, signed graphs with positive and negative edges are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and there is a paucity of balanced paths (i.e., paths with an even number of negative edges) enumeration which makes more sense according to balance theory. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new problem, i.e., enumerate balanced paths with hop constraint (BPHC). A baseline method firstly is proposed by extending the DFS method. To further speed up the efficiency, we construct an almost-satisfy table to instantly correct unbalanced state during the search process. Based on the almost-satisfy table, we develop algorithm BMAS by combining the shortest path length in the process of table update and lookup.
