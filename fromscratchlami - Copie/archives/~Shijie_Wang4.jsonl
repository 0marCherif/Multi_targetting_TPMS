However, existing works lack the ability to identify the essential interaction under the non-stationary environment. We propose causal mean field Q-learning (CMFQ) to address this problem. It has the advantage of MFQ, which can compress the space size dramatically. Besides, it is ever more robust toward the non-stationary caused by increasing agents. We enable agents to identify which ally or opponent is more crucial by asking \"what if\" with the help of the structural causal model (SCM), then pay more attention to more crucial ones. We test CMFQ in mixed cooperative-competitive and cooperative games, which verify our method's scalability performance."}}
