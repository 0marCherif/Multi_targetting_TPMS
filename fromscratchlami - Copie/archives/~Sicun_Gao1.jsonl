We propose to switch the learning objectives from predicting the optimal actions to predicting sets of admissible actions, which we call control admissibility models (CAMs), such that they can be easily composed and used for online inference for an arbitrary number of agents. We design CAMs using graph neural networks and develop training methods that optimize the CAMs in the standard model-free setting, with the additional benefit of eliminating the need for reward engineering typically required to balance collision avoidance and goal-reaching requirements. We evaluate the proposed approach in multi-agent navigation environments. We show that the CAM models can be trained in environments with only a few agents and be easily composed for deployment in dense environments with hundreds of agents, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, neural networks have also been used to characterize safety through the use of barrier functions for complex nonlinear systems. Learned barrier functions approximately encode and enforce a desired safety constraint through a value function, but do not provide any formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a local dynamic programming (DP) based approach to \"patch\" an almost-safe learned barrier at potentially unsafe points in the state space. This algorithm, HJ-Patch, obtains a novel barrier that provides formal safety guarantees, yet retains the global structure of the learned barrier. Our local DP based reachability algorithm, HJ-Patch, updates the barrier function \"minimally\" at points that both (a) neighbor the barrier safety boundary and (b) do not satisfy the safety condition. We view this as a key step to bridging the gap between learning-based barrier functions and Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, providing a framework for further integration of these approaches. We demonstrate that for well-trained barriers we reduce the computational load by 2 orders of magnitude with respect to standard DP-based reachability, and demonstrate scalability to a 6-dimensional system, which is at the limit of standard DP-based reachability."}}

Though it is complete and optimal, it does not scale well. Recent works have been proposed to accelerate it by introducing various heuristics. However, whether these heuristics can apply to non-grid-based problem settings while maintaining their effectiveness remains an open question. In this work, we find that the answer is prone to be no. To this end, we propose a learning-based component, i.e., the Graph Transformer, as a heuristic function to accelerate the planning. The proposed method is provably complete and bounded-suboptimal with any desired factor. We conduct extensive experiments on two environments with dense graphs. Results show that the proposed Graph Transformer can be trained in problem instances with relatively few agents and generalizes well to a larger number of agents, while achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods."}}

Therefore, approaches have focused on creating reward functions by Learning from Observations (LfO) which is the task of learning policies from expert trajectories that only contain state sequences. We propose new methods for LfO for the important class of continuous control problems of learning to stabilize, by introducing intermediate proxy models acting as reward functions between the expert and the agent policy based on Lyapunov stability theory. Our LfO training process consists of two steps. The first step attempts to learn a Lyapunov-like landscape proxy model from expert state sequences without access to any kinematics model, and the second step uses the learned landscape model to guide in training the learner's policy. We formulate novel learning objectives for the two steps that are important for overall training success. We evaluate our methods in real automobile robot environments and other simulated stabilization control problems in model-free settings, like Quadrotor control and maintaining upright positions of Hopper in MuJoCo. We compare with state-of-the-art approaches and show the proposed methods can learn efficiently with less expert observations."}}

Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a representation for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks, and they have been proven effective in industrial recommendation systems. Recently people have discovered the power of using multiple embeddings to represent a user, with the hope that each embedding represents the user's interest in a certain topic. With multi-interest representation, it's important to model the user's preference over the different topics and how the preference change with time. However, existing approaches either fail to estimate the user's affinity to each interest or unreasonably assume every interest of every user fades with an equal rate with time, thus hurting the performance of candidate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Interest Preference (MIP) model, an approach that not only produces multi-interest for users by using the user's sequential engagement more effectively but also automatically learns a set of weights to represent the preference over each embedding so that the candidates can be retrieved from each interest proportionally. Extensive experiments have been done on various industrial-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. "}}

For the more challenging problem of planning in dynamic environments, such as multi-arm assembly tasks and human-robot interaction, motion planners need to consider the trajectories of the dynamic obstacles and reason about temporal-spatial interactions in very large state spaces. We propose a GNN-based approach that uses temporal encoding and imitation learning with data aggregation for learning both the embeddings and the edge prioritization policies. Experiments show that the proposed methods can significantly accelerate online planning over state-of-the-art complete dynamic planning algorithms. The learned models can often reduce costly collision checking operations by more than 1000x, and thus accelerating planning by up to 95%, while achieving high success rates on hard instances as well.

Recent work has proposed the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to formulate decision-making with long-term fairness requirements in dynamically changing environments, and demonstrated major challenges in directly deploying heuristic and rule-based policies that worked well in static environments. We show that policy optimization methods from deep reinforcement learning can be used to find strictly better decision policies that can often achieve both higher overall utility and less violation of the fairness requirements, compared to previously-known strategies. In particular, we propose new methods for imposing fairness requirements in policy optimization by regularizing the advantage evaluation of different actions. Our proposed methods make it easy to impose fairness constraints without reward engineering or sacrificing training efficiency. We perform detailed analyses in three established case studies, including attention allocation in incident monitoring, bank loan approval, and vaccine distribution in population networks. "}}
