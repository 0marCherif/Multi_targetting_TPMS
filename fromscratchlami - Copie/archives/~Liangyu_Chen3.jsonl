Recently, multiple vision-language models (VLMs) have been proposed with excellent commonsense reasoning ability in various domains. However, how to harness the collective power of these complementary VLMs is rarely explored. Existing methods like ensemble still struggle to combine these models with the desired higher-order communications. In this work, we propose Cola, a novel paradigm that coordinates multiple VLMs for visual reasoning. Our key insight is that a language model (LM) can serve as an efficient coordinator to leverage the distinct and complementary capabilities of multiple VLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our finetuning variant, Cola-FT, achieves state-of-the-art performance on outside knowledge VQA, visual entailment, and visual spatial reasoning tasks. Through systematic ablation studies and visualizations, we validate that a coordinator LM comprehends the instruction prompts and the separate functionalities of VLMs and then coordinates them to enable impressive visual reasoning capabilities."}}

However, we uncover a striking contradiction to this promise: at the first few choices, active learning fails to select data as efficiently as random selection. We identify this as the cold start problem in active learning, caused by a biased and outlier initial query. This paper seeks to address the cold start problem and develops a novel active querying strategy, named HaCon, that can exploit the three advantages of contrastive learning: (1) no annotation is required; (2) label diversity is ensured by pseudo-labels to mitigate bias; (3) typical data is determined by contrastive features to reduce outliers. Experiments on three public medical datasets show that HaCon not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin.

This work delves into the impact of generative images, primarily comparing paradigms that harness external data (\\ie generative \\vs retrieval \\vs original). Our key contributions are: \\textbf{1) GenBench Construction:} We devise \\textbf{GenBench}, a broad benchmark comprising 22 datasets with 2548 categories, to appraise generative data across various visual recognition tasks. \\textbf{2) CLER Score:} To address the insufficient correlation of existing metrics (\\eg, FID, CLIP score) with downstream recognition performance, we propose \\textbf{CLER}, a training-free metric indicating generative data's efficiency for recognition tasks prior to training. \\textbf{3) New Baselines:} Comparisons of generative data with retrieved data from the same external pool help to elucidate the unique traits of generative data. \\textbf{4) External Knowledge Injection:} By fine-tuning special token embeddings for each category via Textual Inversion, performance improves across 17 datasets, except when dealing with low-resolution reference images. Our exhaustive benchmark and analysis spotlight generative data's promise in visual recognition, while identifying key challenges for future investigation."}}
