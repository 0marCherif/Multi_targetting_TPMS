Label regularization techniques are also proposed with the motivation of softening the labels while neglecting the relation of classes. Among them, the technique of knowledge distillation proposes to distill the soft label, which contains the knowledge of class relations. However, this technique needs to pre-train an extra cumbersome teacher model. In this paper, we propose a method called Knowledge Refinery (KR), which enables the neural network to learn the relation of classes on-the-fly without the teacher-student training strategy. We propose the definition of decoupled labels, which consist of the original hard label and the residual label. To exhibit the generalization of KR, we evaluate our method in both fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Our empirical results show consistent performance gains under all experimental settings."}}

However, the existing methods suffer from two key limitations. Firstly, most point prediction models only predict an exact value of each time step without flexibility, which can hardly capture the stochasticity of data. Even probabilistic prediction using the likelihood estimation suffers these problems in the same way. Besides, most of them use the auto-regressive generative mode, where ground-truth is provided during training and replaced by the network\u2019s own one-step ahead output during inference, causing the error accumulation in inference. Thus they may fail to forecast time series for long time horizon due to the error accumulation. To solve these issues, in this paper, we propose a new time series forecasting model -- Adversarial Sparse Transformer (AST), based on Generated Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, AST adopts a Sparse Transformer as the generator to learn a sparse attention map for time series forecasting, and uses a discriminator to improve the prediction performance from sequence level. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."}}

Therefore, automatic human fall recognition is vital for the Activities of Daily Living (ADL). In this paper, we try to define multi-level computer vision tasks for the visually observed fall recognition problem and study the methods and pipeline. We make frame-level labels for the fall action on several ADL datasets to test the methods and support the analysis. While current deep-learning fall recognition methods usually work on the sequence-level input, we propose a novel Dynamic Pose Motion (DPM) representation to go a step further, which can be captured by a flexible motion extraction module. Besides, a sequence-level fall recognition pipeline is proposed, which has an explicit two-branch structure for the appearance and motion feature, and has canonical LSTM to make temporal modeling and fall prediction. Finally, while current research only makes a binary classification on the fall and ADL, we further study how to detect the start time and the end time of a fall action in a video-level task. We conduct analysis experiments and ablation studies on both the simulated and real-life fall datasets. The relabelled datasets and extensive experiments form a new baseline on the recognition of falls and ADL."}}

It plays an important role in solving problems in organic synthesis planning. To automate or assist in the retrosynthesis analysis, various retrosynthesis prediction algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them are cumbersome and lack interpretability about their predictions. In this paper, we devise a novel template-free algorithm for automatic retrosynthetic expansion inspired by how chemists approach retrosynthesis prediction. Our method disassembles retrosynthesis into two steps: i) identify the potential reaction center of the target molecule through a novel graph neural network and generate intermediate synthons, and ii) generate the reactants associated with synthons via a robust reactant generation model. While outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin, our model also provides chemically reasonable interpretation."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Transformer to tackle the stock movement prediction task. Furthermore, we present several enhancements for the proposed basic Transformer. Firstly, we propose a Multi-Scale Gaussian Prior to enhance the locality of Transformer. Secondly, we develop an Orthogonal Regularization to avoid learning redundant heads in the multi-head self-attention mechanism. Thirdly, we design a Trading Gap Splitter for Transformer to learn hierarchical features of high-frequency finance data. Compared with other popular recurrent neural networks such as LSTM, the proposed method has the advantage to mine extremely long-term dependencies from financial time series. Experimental results show our proposed models outperform several competitive methods in stock price prediction tasks for the NASDAQ exchange market and the China A-shares market."}}

In addition, label regularization techniques such as label smoothing and label disturbance have also been proposed with the motivation of adding a stochastic perturbation to labels. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive label regularization method, which enables the neural network to learn from the erroneous experience and update the optimal label representation online. On the other hand, compared with knowledge distillation, which learns the correlation of categories using teacher network, our proposed method requires only a minuscule increase in parameters without cumbersome teacher network. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100/ImageNet datasets for image recognition tasks and AGNews/Yahoo/Yelp-Full datasets for text classification tasks. The empirical results show significant improvement under all experimental settings."}}
